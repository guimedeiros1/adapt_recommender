4,1776,"This improbable but charming musical is based on the debates in the Second Continental Congress over whether to declare independence from Britain. The dialogue includes statements made in the delegates' speeches or in their writings. The script closely follows the Tony award-winning play. Benefits of the Movie: With a few corrections, ""1776"" provides a sense of what occurred as the Continental Congress struggled with the momentous question of separation from Britain. It also introduces John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin.",pics/1776-DVDcover.jpg,HT,11,"With a few corrections, ""1776"" provides a sense of what occurred as the Continental Congress struggled with the momentous question of separation from Britain. It also introduces John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin.",nan,"MINOR. One major historical inaccuracy in this movie should be explained. The rebels' military position and the morale of General Washington and the troops are portrayed as being very poor at the time independence was declared. This is incorrect. Before the Declaration of Independence, General Washington and the Continental Congress were optimistic about their military situation. The British Army had been driven from Boston. The rebels were busily fortifying New York against an expected British invasion. Washington had 23,000 troops and thought they could stand against the British. Of course, there were long periods when the rebels were despondent about the military situation, but this did not begin until the British routed Washington's Army at the Battle of Long Island, some seven weeks after the Declaration of Independence was signed. It doesn't make sense that the Congress would issue a Declaration of Independence unless it felt that the rebels could win. There are other distortions of the historical record which the writers obviously felt necessary to keep their audience entertained. After all, this is a musical comedy. While Franklin had his racy side, his anger at the British government and the seriousness with which he backed independence is underplayed. Martha Jefferson did not come to Philadelphia during the convention and her husband was deeply worried about her health. Most of the minor characters shown in the film as buffoons or twits were actually serious men who helped to change the world by risking their lives to create the first modern republic. Why recommend this film despite all of these inaccuracies? Because there is so much that it gets right: the resoluteness of Adams; the eloquent writing of Jefferson; the commanding presence of Franklin; the political maneuvering; and the bitter debate between North and South over slavery. All of these come through clearly. There are a few slightly off-color jokes. For example, Benjamin Franklin, referring to Jefferson, who is closeted with his recently-arrived wife and who had courted her with a violin, remarks, ""God Bless a man who can fiddle."" There are also a few jokes about the need to administer saltpeter to the troops. Parenting Points:     Should your child in either late elementary school or middle school be studying the American Revolution, suggest this film. It is a musical and will hold his or her attention as it presents an interesting way to look at this important period in history. Although you will not want to interject information while the movie is playing, at some other time you should talk about the film's one major historical error which is described in the Possible Problems"" section. While driving or in another moment unrelated to the experience of watching the film, talk to your child about Washington, Franklin, Jefferson, and Adams, some of the most remarkable men this country has produced.",nan
2,12 Years a Slave,"Description: This movie is a cinematic representation of the best selling slave narrative of Solomon Northup, a free black man living in upstate New York who was kidnapped in 1841 and sold into slavery. The film shows the life of a slave in the American South primarily on two plantations: one governed by a relatively benevolent master and the other subject to a brutal tyrant. They also expose the particularly hard lot of slave women and the operation of the slave trade. The movie is an excellent resource for 12th grade and college classes in U.S. History and for ELA units on the slave narrative genre.",pics/12-years-a-slave-dvd-cover.jpg,LT,15,nan,"Objectives/Student Outcomes Using this Learning Guide: Students will have a vivid understanding of the lives endured by slaves in the American South. Students will be introduced to slavery as a world-wide phenomenon that has existed for millennia and which continues to exist. Students will be introduced to the slave narrative, the first genre of African-American literature.",nan,"Rationale: It is important for students to understand the brutality and thoroughness of slavery as practiced in the American South and which was eradicated only a brutal and bloody civil war. It is also helpful for students to understand the world-wide dimensions of slavery, the current status of slavery, and to read at least parts of a slave narrative, the first genre of African-American literature."
21,Anne Frank,nan,pics/AF-whole-story-DVDcover.jpg,HT,12,"Each of these films will supplement and confirm the benefits of reading the book, Anne Frank: the Diary of a Young Girl.",nan,"Except for ""The Diary of Anne Frank,"" the films contain disturbing photographs of people who were imprisoned or died in the concentration camps, mass graves, etc. Unfortunately, in a world which suffered through the 20th century, such images should be shown to all children at one point or another. ""Anne Frank, the Whole Story"" also contains dramatic recreations of scenes of women being stripped of their clothing while being processed at Auschwitz and camp inmates suffering from illness, starvation, exposure etc. There is one scene of full frontal nudity of the actress playing Anne's mother. These are, as they should be, deeply upsetting. We suggest this film only for ages fourteen and older. Parenting Points:     If your child is reading Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl, studying the Holocaust, or learning about WWII, watch any of these films as a family. Tell your kids that there are two reasons the Diary is so popular. First, the story of Anne Frank tugs at our heart strings. Second, the Diary is an excellent description of a young person struggling with many of the issues of adolescence. Anne's wise approach to growing up is still valid today. Ask and answer the Quick Discussion Question or any of the other Discussion Questions. Families can also watch ""Anne Frank: the Whole Story"" at any time.",nan
277,On The Waterfront,"This movie is about organized crime's penetration of a longshoreman's union in New York during the 1950s. Several men break the community's code of silence to stand up to the gangsters and expose the murder of a friend. The script was adapted from ""Crime on the Waterfront,"" a Pulitzer prize winning newspaper expose written by Terry Malcom and published in the New York Sun. Benefits: ""On the Waterfront"" provides an introduction to the problems of corruption in labor unions and the need for courageous individuals to stand up to corrupt union bosses. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Terry is considered by actors to be a classic demonstration of ""method"" acting. Possible Problems: MODERATE. There are several killings by gun and bloody fist fights. However, the purpose of these incidents is to advance the story, not to thrill the audience. Alcohol use and abuse are shown.",pics/on-the-waterfront-DVDcover.jpg,,12,"""On the Waterfront"" provides an introduction to the problems of corruption in labor unions and the need for courageous individuals to stand up to corrupt union bosses.

8,The Adventures of Robin Hood,This is the best film version of the Robin Hood legend.,pics/adventures-of-robin-hood-DVDcover.jpg,LT,8,"The Robin Hood legend, as shown in this movie, tells the story of the reconciliation between the Saxon people and the Normans who had conquered England in 1066. It was this reconciliation which created the English people as we know them today.",nan,"MINOR. Robin's arrows always seem to strike his opponents in the heart, and they die then and there without blood, which is exactly the way that children play at war, cops and robbers, etc. There is a little graphic violence when a Saxon is struck in the head. There is a potentially disturbing scene in which a little girl pleads for her father's life.",nan
6,Abraham and Mary Lincoln: A House Divided,"This PBS documentary describes the life of Abraham Lincoln and Mary, his wife, from birth to death. The films are suitable for those who know little about Abraham and Mary Lincoln and also for those who are fairly knowledgeable about our 16th President and his wife.",pics/Abraham-and-mary-lincoln-DVD-cover.jpg,HT,10,"""Abraham and Mary Lincoln: A House Divided"" is not limited to political events and the history of the period, but also presents information about the background, personalities, and family life of Mary and Abraham Lincoln. It provides a rounded picture of this famous and star-crossed couple. Possible Problems:     None. Parenting Points:     ""Abraham & Mary Lincoln: A House Divided"" is excellent for viewing with a child in middle school or high school who is studying the Civil War. This documentary shows the human side of Abraham and Mary Lincoln. After seeing the film, share with your child Walt Whitman's poem, Oh Captain! My Captain! It is important that children understand the sentiment Whitman presents in his poem. It is also important that they understand how poetry illustrates feelings that otherwise are difficult to express and that they share the beauty of poetry with their parents.",nan,None.,nan
9,The African Queen,"The scene is Africa at the beginning of the First World War. A jack-of-all-trades boat operator of questionable reputation rescues a spinster missionary. Her brother, the only other missionary in the village, has died. Together the spinster and the boat operator undertake a hazardous but spectacular river journey and find their dream.",pics/african-queen-DVDcover.jpg,HT,10,"While the film has long been regarded as a classic romance, it can also be used to teach children about technological innovation, the steam engine, the history of WWI in Africa, and the lakes of Africa. Charlie, the boat operator, solves many engineering problems to get his skiff down the river. He performs more engineering marvels to sink the German warship. Rose, the spinster missionary, is a role model for a determined woman. Both Rose and Charlie change their lives and rise to the occasion. This movie examines the relationship between two very different people and how a common goal leads them to understand, and love, one another. Possible Problems:    There is a brief scene of many black men fighting like children over a cigar dropped by the engineer. Alcohol abuse and smoking are shown with only a little negative comment. Parenting Points:     The African Queen is best shown to high school students who have an interest in classic film. Tell your child to note the images of Africans presented in the film and ask them how they think African Americans would feel about these characterizations and how film may illustrate tribal people today.",nan,There is a brief scene of many black men fighting like children over a cigar dropped by the engineer.

10,"Ancient Alexandria, Hypatia, and the Decline of Greco-Roman Civilization — using the Film Agora","Description: The first 78 minutes of the film (until the view of the Earth after the pogrom) present a reasonable, if sometimes flawed, presentation of the topics described in the note.",,,,nan,nan,"Possible Problems: This film has been incorrectly criticized as being anti-Christian. Actually, the movie is against intolerant fundamentalism — that of the Pagans who started the fight that led to the destruction of the Serapeum, as well as Cyril's bitter approach to communal relations which, according to some historians, ""fomented the pervading atmosphere of hostility which led to Hypatia's death."" The movie was screened by the Vatican before it was released, and the Catholic Church made no objection. TWM agrees with the statement that ""[Agora] is not against Christians and most certainly not against the Christians of today."" Both quotations from World Catholic Association for Communication — SIGNIS Statement: Agora, April 18, 2010. The first 78 minutes of the Movie: On one occasion the actress playing Hypatia is seen fully nude from the back with a fleeting partial view of one of her breasts as she exits a bath. Later in the film, her clothed breast is groped for a moment by a rebellious slave who is in love with her. He immediately repents and begs her forgiveness. An actress portraying a young Jewish girl is shown for a second losing her clothing in the scene of the pogrom. There is some violent close quarters combat between Pagans and Christians which is shown to be painful, however, the R rating for violence is undeserved given what is now rated as PG-13. The Remainder of the Film: If the entire film is used, in addition to the historical inaccuracies, there is one additional scene in which the actress playing Hypatia is again shown fully nude from the rear just before she is strangled by Davus in an act of mercy.","Rationale for Using the Movie: Properly introduced, scaffolded and corrected, the film provides a vivid picture of the topics described in the Note above. This knowledge is essential to an understanding of the arc of the history of the West. The movie and the comparison with the historical record can also provide an excellent opportunity for the study of historical fiction, the changes in attitudes toward gender in Western Civilization, and the dangers of intolerance and communal strife."
279,The Ox-Bow Incident,"It's 1865 and a frontier town in Nevada is rocked by the news that a respected rancher has been murdered. The sheriff is out of town. Impatient townspeople form a posse. Three strangers are soon found herding cattle marked with the brand belonging to the rancher. They claim they bought the cattle, but there is no bill of sale. One of the strangers has the rancher's gun. He tells the posse that he bought it from the rancher, but again, there is no evidence of this. Most of the posse wants to string the strangers up immediately. A few argue that the posse should wait and turn the strangers over to the sheriff. What will the posse do? The film is based on the novel of the same name by Walter Van Tilburg Clark. Benefits of the Movie: This film conveys powerful lessons in justice, conformity, masculine role identity, guilt and the results of mob rule. For English Language Arts classes, it offers an opportunity to help students derive theme from a work of fiction. See particularly the ELA Discussion Questions and An Exercise in Creating Thematic Statements. It also provides an opportunity for writing assignments. For Social Studies and Civics classes the movie provides a visceral lesson in the meaning and importance of due process. This Learning Guide provides a summary of important elements of due process in criminal matters, Social Studies and Civics Discussion Questions and Writing Assignments.",pics/ox-bow-incident-DVDcover.jpg,,12,"This film conveys powerful lessons in justice, conformity, masculine role identity, guilt and the results of mob rule.",nan,"MINOR. The characters in the film condone drinking lots of whiskey and fighting. One of the men to be hanged derides the posse for its haste and unwillingness to be fair with the epithet that they are not ""white men."" Equating lynching with blacks is a backhanded, but ironic, racial slur. At the end of the film, the leader of the posse goes into a room off-camera. We hear the sound of a gunshot as he commits suicide. Each of these issues can lead to an interesting discussion. See Discussion Questions below. Parenting Points:     Immediately after the movie, or at odd times over the next week (for example at the dinner table or in the car on the way to school) bring up the subject of the movie and comment that justice is one of the most basic human rights. Without justice, there is no reason to obey any of the rules of society. You may also want to bring up some of the Discussion Questions. Don't worry if you can only get through a few questions. Just taking the film seriously and discussing it is the key. If your child is reading the book or watching the movie in school, there is great benefit in watching the movie with your child after the assignment has been completed and discussing the themes of the film. It might also be a good to read the excerpt from Martin's letter to his wife set out in the ELA - Writing Assignment #1.",nan

20,Anne B. Real,"Cynthia Gimenez lives in New York City. Her father, a school teacher, has recently died. Her brother is acting strangely. Her older sister has a child out of wedlock. The family is on welfare and lives in public housing. Before her father died Cynthia made straight A's. Now she's a C student. What Cynthia dreams of is rapping. At home she practices in the bathroom in front of the mirror and spends hours in her room writing out verses. She reads and rereads a book her father gave to her before he died, Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl. Benefits of the Movie:     TWM recommends this film for classes in English and Health. Anne B. Real can motivate children of all races and ethnicities to read Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl. It demonstrates that the timeless messages of the book can reach across the continents, across the decades, across cultures, and across racial lines to underscore our common humanity. For Health classes there are many lessons in the film that relate to drug addiction, codependence, breaking out, and finding one's own voice. Possible Problems:     MINIMAL. There is almost no sex and almost no violence in this movie. There is some profanity. No drug use is shown. (The reason for the PG-13 rating, ""violence and drug content,"" is simply incorrect. However, PG-13 is probably the best of the available ratings because the movie deals powerfully with issues of drug addiction and death.) The most upsetting scene in the movie occurs when a character we have grown to love is killed accidentally. We don't see the injury, just the person on the ground and a spreading pool of blood. The scene is important to advance the plot. The worst problem in the movie is that Cynthia, the heroine, helps a schoolmate cheat on an exam by passing him her completed answers and then redoing his answers as if they were hers. However, this is not shown as good behavior and Jerome (the schoolmate) is pursuing an unethical and dangerous life-style that eventually gets him killed. This can be handled by ignoring it and focusing on other issues. Or, it can be dealt with directly by saying, at a break after the cheating scene, that there is one thing about the movie you disagree with, and asking what it is. When the right answer is revealed, describe why. First, it's dishonest. Second, in today's world a path to a decent life requires at least some education, for these kids or for anyone else.

75,"The Chorus (""Les Choristes"")","The time is shortly after WWII; the place is somewhere in rural France at Fond de L'Etang (The Bottom of the Pond), a school for boys with discipline problems or whose families cannot keep them. ""Les Choristes"" tells the story of Pierre Morhange, a student with undiscovered musical talent, and Mssr. Mathieu, a frustrated musician who serves as the dean of discipline. Opposing the school's strict methods of controlling the students, Mathieu begins to use music to affect change in the rowdy and ill-natured boys. The successful effort to create a choir, with Morhange as the featured soloist, changes the students and the teacher. As sometimes occurs with innovative and inspiring teachers, Mathieu is fired. Benefits of the Movie:     Students will empathize with the young characters in the film and benefit from the demonstration of hope and caring that constitute the theme. English Language Arts classes can focus on explicating translations of the poems that constitute lyrics for the songs O Nuit! and Vois Sur Ton Chemin. This Guide provides exercises using the ""say, mean, matter"" method of analysing poetry. ""Les Choristes"" also provides excellent opportunities for students to discuss or write about themes in a story. See the discussion questions. ELA standards in all states require students to be able to find meaning in a poem, to ferret out the theme and ideas in a story, and to write about their conclusions. French Language Classes will benefit when students translate the lyrics of songs from ""Les Choristes"". Students can then practice their skills in French by writing explications of the poems. See Explication of the Lyrics of Two Songs. The discussion questions can prompt interesting exchanges and many can serve as writing prompts for essays in the language of the film. Music classes and choirs may benefit from improved motivation and esprit de corps after watching this film. Students can also be asked to trace the history of children's choirs, both in Europe and the United States. Presentations can be made using YouTube or actual recordings of famous choirs such as the Vienna Boy's Choir or the several choirs made up of young people that are based in American cities.

18,Angels in the Outfield,"Roger, approximately ten years of age, is made a ward of the state and placed in a foster home. Apparently his mother has died and his father suffers from immaturity so severe that it prevents him from wanting to raise his son. But Roger, as most kids would be, is desperate to be reunited with his dad. In a cynical joke, Roger's father promises that if the California Angels (at that time perennially in last place in their division) win the pennant, he will come back and claim Roger. The child then prays that the Angels will win the pennant. Suddenly angels appear from heaven to help the team. In the end, Roger finds a home and a father, although neither are what he expected. Benefits of the Movie:     This film will acquaint children with the foster care system and show adult characters who are nurturing. Other adult characters, not mature at the beginning of the film, grow so that they can undertake the responsibilities of a parent. They are contrasted with Roger's father, who is too immature to nurture anyone. ""Angels in the Outfield"" also shows parenting relationships crossing racial lines and the beauty of friendship and loyalty. Children love ""Angels in the Outfield."" Critics have justifiably called this film ""a flimsy exercise in feel-good sentimentality so strained it suggests that even God scans the box scores."" (Hal Hinson, Washington Post, July 15, 1994.) This film should be shown to children old enough to know that God does not scan the box scores.

286,Patton,"This film is a description of the military career and personality of General George S. Patton, Jr., one of the most effective and colorful U.S. Generals of WWII.",pics/patton-DVDcover.jpg,,12,"""Patton"" will introduce children to Generals Patton, Bradley and Rommel. It shows a brilliant and effective soldier who had trouble being, as all great generals must, a diplomat as well as a fighter . The makers of this film tried to provide an accurate portrayal of General Patton, consulting historical texts and interviewing people who served with him. They received a confidential letter from President Eisenhower, Patton's superior during the war, who knew when to hold Patton back and when to unleash him. George C. Scott gives a masterful performance as Patton.",nan,"MODERATE. This film glosses over a number of Patton's serious problems as a general and as a human being (see Helpful Background section). There is a substantial amount of profanity in the film, shown as a symptom of what the film presents as Patton's biggest problem, his inability to govern his tongue. Parenting Points:     Before watching the film, briefly describe the General Patton and the highlights of his career. See Helpful Background. Immediately after the movie, or at odd times over the next week (for example at the dinner table or in the car on the way to school) bring up some of the Discussion Questions, starting with the Quick Discussion Question in the sidebar. Don't worry if you can only get through a few questions. Just taking the film seriously and discussing it is the key. Allow your child to watch the movie several times and continue to bring up discussion questions relating to the film.",nan
24,Apollo 13,"This film is a realistic dramatization of NASA's Apollo 13 mission. Because of mechanical problems, Apollo 13 failed to reach the moon and was almost lost. The movie builds great suspense and is deeply absorbing. Benefits of the Movie: ""Apollo 13"" shows men solving problems with intelligence, skill, teamwork, and bravery. The movie shows the process of preparing for space travel in the 1970s. It raises issues of loyalty to individuals on the team against the need for loyalty to the team as a whole. The role that Ken Mattingly played in saving the mission, even when bad luck prevented him from being on the spacecraft, shows that even if you cannot be on the first team, you can still perform an essential role, save the day, and become a hero. Each of the astronauts, in his own way, is a positive male role model. Possible Problems:    MINOR. The party scene at the very beginning of the film contains a short, objectionable exchange between the Swigert character and a young woman. He is trying to pick her up by comparing docking a spacecraft to sexual intercourse. Younger children will not understand this exchange. When older children see the film, distract them by talking about something else during this scene or fast-forward the film beyond it. It would be a shame to disqualify this otherwise wonderful movie for 10 seconds of dialogue. Mild profanity is used by the astronauts and NASA personnel in extraordinarily tense situations.

Scenes of people dying from the flu may disturb some students.,An influenza pandemic is one of the greatest threats to modern global society. Working through scenarios of catastrophic situations help students think in advance about how to react to them. The websites of the CDC and HHS contain important information about health issues and will be a resource for students throughout their lives.
91,Cross Creek,"Taken from the memoirs of Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, ""Cross Creek"" is a beautiful tale of a woman determined to live independently in rural Florida and become a writer. During the first third of the 20th century, this was an unusual and difficult lifestyle. Benefits of the Movie: This film has many benefits. Rawlings is a strong woman, determined to become a writer at a time when this was not the usual path for a young woman. The movie describes rural Florida in the first third of the 20th century. ""Cross Creek"" will be helpful in health classes to illustrate issues of family relationships, demonstrating that families are units and that each member is affected by what another family member does. It provides a graphic example of the consequences of risky behavior such as running away and getting drunk. The film demonstrates the tragedy and futility of suicide and shows the law of unintended consequences in action. ""Cross Creek"" also introduces the concept of ""suicide by cop"". In English and literature classes, the film can serve as a basis for class discussion and essay writing. An intriguing use of the film is to show how Ms. Rawlings' actual experiences were transmuted into her classic novel The Yearling. Because the contrasts between the film and the novel are so interesting, ""Cross Creek"" will have best effect if shown to children who have already read the novel. We do not advise substituting the film The Yearling for the novel. While the film is excellent, the novel is a classic and should be read by all children. They can watch the movie after they read the novel. Possible Problems:    SERIOUS. Ellie, the girl who raised the deer, curses her father for killing her pet and runs away. She eventually returns unharmed. But Ellie's father, who doted on her, becomes despondent. Feeling that things could never be the same, the father either commits suicide by provoking the local sheriff into killing him or gets himself into a situation in which the sheriff accidentally shoots him. (See discussion: Did Marsh Turner Really Commit Suicide? in the Helpful Background Section.) There is some mild profanity. Parenting Points:     Should your child be assigned to read ""The Yearling"" in school, this film will make the book far more interesting as it is the true story upon which the book is based. For children who view the film without the obligation to read the book, you may want to bring the book home and use the child's interest in the film to draw him or her into reading the novel. After the film is over, you may want to talk about the differences between the book and the movie. You may also want to discuss the problem of Suicide by Cop which creates many victims: the individual who chose to die, their family members, and the cop who was essentially forced into assisting in the suicide. For all children, ask and walk your kids through the answer to the Quick Discussion Question.",pics/cross-creek-DVDcover.jpg,LT,14,"This film has many benefits.

90,Cowspiracy,"Description: Cowspiracy describes what happens when an environmental activist reads that animal agriculture is responsible for more pollution than the entire transportation sector. He is also told that animal agriculture and the crops necessary to feed those animals consume more than 50% of the potable water in the U.S. and that a hamburger with 1/3rd of a pound of beef requires 660 gallons of water to produce. As he digs deeper into the literature about the environmental costs of animal agriculture, he learns about the deforestation of the Amazon to grow crops to feed livestock, the pollution caused by the many hundred million tons of animal waste generated by the industry each year, and the antibiotic resistance caused by pumping livestock full of antibiotics to prevent disease among animals closely confined in large numbers. Then he learns that hunger in the world would be eliminated if the grain that is fed to farm animals were available for human consumption. The activist wonders why he can't read anything about animal agriculture on the websites and in the literature of some major environmental organizations. He questions why government agencies charged with reducing pollution don't publicize these facts and encourage people to reduce their intake of meat and dairy. He asks for an explanation . . . and is met with silence.",pics/cowspiracy_cow.jpg,BL,13,nan,"Objectives/Student Outcomes Using this Learning Guide: (1) The movie, supplemented by the discussion questions and the assignments in this Learning Guide, will acquaint students with the role that animal agriculture plays in environmental degradation. (2) Students assigned TWM's Worksheet for the Aristotelian Modes of Persuasion in Cowspiracy will practice analyzing arguments using Aristotle's appeals to logos, pathos, and ethos. (3) Student who read TWM's Motivated Blindness and the Normalcy Bias: A Brief Introduction will understand and be able to apply these psychological concepts. (4) Teachers can use the film and the Learning Guide to demonstrate that even statistics (logos) can be framed in a misleading manner.","Possible Problems: Minor: At the end of the movie, the filmmakers explain why they believe that the only solution for the environmental problems caused by animal agriculture is a vegan diet. The filmmakers would argue (and TWM agrees) that this is a strength of the film because it is clear that a drastic reduction in meat and dairy consumption is an essential component of any effective effort to mitigate human impact on the environment. The film shows a backyard farmer cutting the head from a duck and draining the blood into a bucket.","Rationale for Using the Movie: This film discloses a major and as yet unpublicized cause of humankind's impact on the environment. In ELA classes, the film serves as an excellent example of Aristotle's appeals to logos, pathos, and ethos. The movie also provides an opportunity to introduce three important concepts which will serve students all their lives: ""motivated blindness,"" ""the bias toward normalcy,"" and how statistics can be used to mislead."
26,Around the World in 80 Days,"The year is 1872. A well-to-do English gentleman, Phileas Fogg, bets members of his club that he can circumnavigate the world in 80 days. The bet is so large that unless he wins, his entire fortune will be lost. The film, based on a Jules Verne novel, is the suspense filled story of Fogg's attempt to win the bet.

The problems with this film would disqualify it if it were not a lighthearted comedy in which nothing is intended to be taken seriously. A good summary of the problems with this film is set out below: The wealthy English establishment is very conservative and against progress and new ideas. There is considerable betting on Fogg's journey. Fogg believes in progress, science, and intellectual deduction. Passepartout refers to him as ""master."" An Arab sadistically insists Passepartout fight a bull even if he doesn't know how. Fogg bribes people to make his journey faster. Passepartout breaks Brahman religious beliefs and is chased by a mob. One of the reasons they rescue Auda is that she was educated in England. They judge local religious customs by English standards. Fogg is arrested for desecrating a religious ritual; he immediately posts bail and skips town. Fogg speaks Pidgin English to a Chinese who, he finds out, speaks perfect English.

131,Hero's Journey,"This worksheet will help students trace the stages and identify the archetypes of the Hero's Journey/Monomyth. It is based on the ideas of Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell, as developed and applied to film by Chris Vogler. The stages and archetypes of the Hero's Jouney set out below have been adapted from Vogler's book The Writers Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers, 3rd Edition.
There are several formulations of the stages of the Hero's Journey. One way to approach teaching the Hero's Journey is to have students find at least two of the methods on the Internet, one suggested by Campbell and the other by Vogler. Alow students to choose and apply the system of analysis that they prefer. This can be done in groups or individually. TWM has used Vogler's stages and his description of the archetypes, however, the section on the stages can be easily adapted to Campbell's configuration. 

This worksheet is designed to be used in conjunction with TWM's Stages and Archetypes of the Hero's Journey — Introducing the Monomyth. TWM lesson plans on the story of the quest are listed at Literature Subject Index. Each contains notes on responses to the questions set out below and assignments relating to the use of the Journey/Monomyth in the form it takes in the movie.

""Ballad of a Soldier"" is a classic WWII Soviet propaganda film produced by a country that was at the time an ally of the United States and Great Britain. The movie is one of the most honored and popular films of its time and genre. Benefits of the Movie: This movie shows the Eastern front from the Russian point of view, the massive hardships suffered by the Russian people during WWII, and their heroism in repelling the German invaders. Possible Problems: None. While this is a propaganda film, it is about a war in which the U.S. and the Soviets fought on the same side. It shows the valor of a people defending their homeland. Parenting Points:     Tell children that this is what really good Russian Soviet propaganda looked like. They were our allies during the Second World War, the time this movie was made.

28,The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman,"This movie is a fictionalized account of the life of one of the last surviving slaves. Starting with Jane Pittman's childhood on a plantation, the film details her life through Reconstruction, the reassertion of the power of the Southern white establishment, the two World Wars and the Depression, ending with the Civil Rights Movement of the early 1960s. The film is adapted from the book by Ernest Gaines. Benefits of the Movie: This is the story of a strong and loving woman who, over a long life, moves from being a slave to participating in a civil rights demonstration. Possible Problems: MODERATE. This movie shows a lynching by the Ku Klux Klan, attacks by gangs, and murders. The violence is portrayed in a mildly graphic way. However, it is all pertinent to the story, and it is not offensive. The term ""nigger"" is used but only appropriately. Parenting Points:     Tell your children that while this story is fiction, the events that it depicts are very realistic.

45,Bend It Like Beckham,"This story focuses on two English girls who want to play football (soccer) professionally. Jesminder (Jess) is from an Indian Sikh family that has immigrated to England. Julie is from a traditional English family. Each suffers from the prejudices of her parents. Jess' parents believe that playing football and displaying her legs to the world are not proper for a traditional Sikh girl. They forbid her to play. Julie's friendship with Jess, her interest in playing football, and her disinterest in things feminine lead her mother to fear that Julie is a lesbian. It all comes to a head at Jess' sister's version of the ""Big Fat Sikh Wedding"".",pics/bend-it-like-beckham-DVDcover.jpg,,13,"This movie shows: (1) girls being serious about sports, in this case soccer, called football everywhere but in the U.S.A.; (2) a child of immigrant parents in Britain breaking out of traditional Sikh life-styles; and (3) parents adapting to the unexpected paths their children take. A core message is that ""in the modern world children have to be allowed to forge their own futures. ... [W]hile we need to be reasonably understanding of parents and elderly folk who cling to the old ways, we don't need to make excuses for their intolerance.""",nan,"MODERATE. Jesminder and Pinky, her sister, lie to their parents: Jess to play football and Pinky to make love with her fiance. The viewer will want to root for Jess because, until the end of the film, her parents won't allow her to play football, and playing football is Jess' dream. (Pinky's lie is not a major issue in the film and is neither endorsed nor criticized.) There are two ways to handle the deception issue. The first, and probably the best, is to ignore it. Jess' parents are being unreasonable and Jess is uncomfortable with the lie, which in the end, doesn't work. Eventually, Jess and her parents come to an understanding. In a good natured way, the movie points out some of the foibles of the Sikh community in Britain. There is also a good amount of profanity and sexually related dialog, much of it in British slang. There is at least one obscene gesture. The car in which Pinky and her boyfriend are making love is briefly shown rocking back and forth.",nan
123,Fail-Safe,"It's the middle of the Cold War. Armed to the teeth with nuclear weapons, the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. (Russia) stand toe to toe, ready to destroy each other, and the world, on a moments' notice. The countries rely upon the logic of Mutual Assured Destruction to prevent war. One day, due to a mechanical failure, a group of U.S. war planes, armed with hydrogen bombs, flies off toward the Soviet Union. It's target is Moscow. It doesn't respond to orders to return. WHAT DO WE DO NOW?!!! The President of the United States is called upon to make quick and important decisions. How can he assure the Soviet Premier that this is not the start of an all out nuclear attack? If the bombers cannot be stopped, how does he propose to convince the Soviet Union not to launch an attack that will destroy the United States? Or, as some advise, should he simply order an all out first strike and start WWIII with a big advantage? The movie is based on a best selling novel of the same name by Harvey Wheeler and Eugene Burdick. The experience of viewing this film will be enhanced if used at part of TeachWithMovies.com's Lesson Plan on Mass Casualties and Making Decisions About War. Benefits of the Movie:     ""Fail-Safe"" serves as a reminder that, while nuclear tensions have diminished, there are still thousands of nuclear weapons in arsenals around the world. See Estimates by the Natural Resources Defense Council. Additionally, several nations who do not already have nuclear weapons are trying to build them. The chances of an unintended launch of a missile or of a nuclear accident remain all too real.

A woman makes a pass at Professor Groeteschele, the villain of the film. He slaps her. The film begins with a dream sequence showing the agony of a bull being killed in a bullfight. While this sequence adds a layer of meaning to the film, it is not essential. Children who are sensitive and who are empathic towards animals should be warned and perhaps they should skip the first 60 seconds of the film (until the end of the dream sequence). One of the characters, under extreme provocation, commits suicide. There is mild profanity in the movie. The words ""damn"" and ""hell"" are used several times. The dramatic tension in ""Fail-Safe"" builds slowly through the first 25 minutes. It may be necessary to remind children during this time that the drama will become intense as the film unfolds its gripping tale. Some critics claim that the fears of accidental nuclear war are exaggerated and that the fail-safe system shown in the movie is much different than those actually employed by the United States. See compendium of critiques and defenses of the film at StrategyPage.com. The points of the critics are important and should be discussed with children who see the film. The debate over whether the film is inaccurate, and whether that even matters, is an excellent way to lead children to the benefits of this film. See Discussion Question #2. Parenting Points:     Ask and help your child to answer the Quick Discussion Question. Be sure to mention that in 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force strongly advised that the U.S. start a pre-emptive nuclear war against the Soviet Union.

1,12 Angry Men,"Description: These movies depict jury deliberations in a murder trial.

While attending a carnival, he sees a girl for whom he has a crush, however, he is deeply embarrassed when he is not allowed to join her on a carnival ride because he is not tall enough.

132,Documentaries,"TeachWithMovies.com offers two film study worksheets designed to help teachers quickly create lesson plans based on documentary films; one is for movies that are primarily informational and the other for films designed to persuade the viewer on a matter of political or social significance. 

The worksheets assist students in analyzing the documentary. They allow students to take notes during breaks while watching the movie or when the film is over. The prompts on the worksheets can be used to facilitate class discussions or form the basis for writing assignments.",,,0,Many movie worksheets contain questions about specific scenes or details to test whether students have been paying attention. This ensures that students follow the film and don't daydream or do homework. This type of worksheet is clearly beneficial when the film has educational value or is going to be used to drive assignments requiring the exercise of important skills. It's certainly much better than simply putting the DVD in the player and letting the movie run.,nan,nan,"The worksheets are designed to be copied on the front and back of one sheet of paper. 

The prospect of having to respond to the prompts assures that students will pay attention to the film. Classes should read the worksheet prompts before the movie is shown to alert them to the questions they will be expected to answer. This will encourage the class to think about the movie and its content. Students should be discouraged from taking notes while the movie is playing. The best practice is to allow several three to five minute breaks during the film for note taking and an additional five or ten minutes at the film's end for students to complete their notes."

This demonstrates that the modern view of the Solar system took centuries to develop and introduces students to Hypatia, the greatest women of ancient Greek mathematics and philosophy. Animations from the Internet show how the motion of the planets (the ""wanderers"" in ancient Greek) are explained in both the geocentric and heliocentric models of the Solar system."
50,Billy Elliot,"Billy, the 11-year-old son of an English mining family, stumbles onto a ballet class held in the same community center as his boxing lessons. Billy's family is under tremendous strain. His mother has just died. Billy's grandmother has a tendency to wander off and cannot take care of herself. Billy's father, a miner of limited education, and his older brother, are walking the picket lines during the violent and unsuccessful 1984 British miner's strike. There is little money. Billy's father doesn't approve of boys taking ballet, while Billy finds that he would rather dance than do anything else. Will Billy pursue his dream? Will the beleaguered Elliot family pull together and heal? Benefits of the Movie: This warmhearted story shows children the rewards of perseverance in following their own star despite parental or popular opinion. It demonstrates the redemptive agency of love in a family under enormous stress and shows a father coming through as a parent after some egregious errors. The film illuminates the tensions and sorrows of a family dealing with the loss of its wife and mother while the grandmother gently sinks into senility. (Billy lovingly takes care of his grandmother.) In this film a friendship between two boys survives the fact that one is homosexual and the other probably is not. ""Billy Elliot"" also illustrates the far-reaching influence that a dedicated teacher can have on a child's development. The family's struggle is set against the background of the 1984 English coal miner's strike in which the British government, determined to drastically reform the country's bloated and inefficient coal industry, crushed the miner's union, and changed English society. The film reveals the sacrifices required of striking union workers and their families, as well as the anguish of a community whose way of life is doomed in the face of new economic conditions.",pics/billy-elliot-DVDcover.jpg,EN,12,"This warmhearted story shows children the rewards of perseverance in following their own star despite parental or popular opinion.

Profanity pervades the dialogue. Billy's father and older brother Tony curse continually. Billy and his friend Michael curse matter-of-factly. Though softened by an English North Country/Scottish Border accent, the f... word, pronounced as rhyming with ""cook,"" is heard in every sentence of some speeches. See Discussion Question #19. The family pulls together in the end, but not before violent arguments. In one of them, the father, pushed to his limits by not being able to support his family, by the strike, by the recent death of his wife, by having to raise a child he cannot understand, and by many other events beyond his control, throws Billy against a wall. The father also hits his older son, an adult, drawing blood in a futile attempt to stop the young man from an early morning foray to damage company property. There are frequent violent clashes between the police and striking miners. Billy hits another child. No gore is shown, and there is no thrill factor to the violence in this film. No serious injury is suffered by anyone in these incidents. Billy defies his father and surreptitiously attends dance classes. While some parents might object to this part of the story, we see it as a strength. The father's insistence that Billy box rather than take ballet restricted the growth and development of his child. Had Billy complied with that instruction, he would have missed his life's calling. In other words, the parent was wrong in such a fundamental way that the child's disobedience was justified. Billy's best friend Michael tries on women's clothing, as the film reveals his nascent homosexuality. The film accepts Michael's homosexuality without any negative implication. Some parents may object to anything other than a negative portrayal of homosexuality. However, Billy, who appears to be heterosexual, is able to gently decline Michael's advances and set boundaries to their relationship. In this way, the film provides an excellent model for the maintenance of friendships between people who are substantially different. In addition, the juxtaposition of Billy, who dances and is heterosexual, with Michael, who is homosexual but does not dance, demonstrates the fallacy of stereotyping the sexual orientations of male ballet dancers. We see the film's treatment of this friendship as a strength of the movie. The film shows a community at odds with its government. The strikers protest and the police attack. A striker moons the police. This incident distracts a librarian while Billy steals a book on ballet that the librarian would not let him check out. The police are a constant and malevolent presence. There is a lot of smoking in the film. Why recommend this film with all of these possible problems? The reason is twofold. First, pervading the film and triumphing at the end is the essential human quality of loving and caring for others.",nan
60,Bridge to Terabithia,"Fifth grader Jess Aarons is an artistic loner, the only boy in an economically stressed and culturally deprived rural Virginia family. He loves to draw, and he loves to run. When Leslie and her family move to an abandoned farm next door, Jess learns how friendship draws out the best in each individual, how other families operate, and how tragedy can be overcome. The film is true to the book, except that the filmmakers have made use of special effects to enhance the battles that Leslie and Jess fight against the imagined enemies of their fantasy kingdom of Terabithia. Benefits of the Movie: Students who have read the novel will enjoy seeing the images that Patterson creates in her writing appear on screen. From this they can learn about how ideas are shown rather than told. Watching the film will also repeat and confirm lessons based on the book. Jess' bridge to Terabithia is of great value as a template for a healthy way to deal with a catastrophic loss.

204,The King and I,"It is the early 1860s. The King of Siam (King Mongcut) hires an English school teacher to provide a Western education for his children. The teacher and the King develop a deep affection for one another despite the great differences in their cultures. This film is based on the Broadway musical. The story is essentially a fantasy. While the ""King"" portrayed in ""The King and I"" did exist, King Mongcut was a much different (and more interesting) man than the character shown in the musical or in the film. Ancient Siam is the modern country of Thailand.",pics/king-and-i-DVDcover.jpg,,8,"The best thing about this film is the music. Many of the songs such as, ""Getting to Know You,"" ""I Whistle a Happy Tune,"" and ""Shall We Dance"" are suitable for the voices of elementary school children. The production of ""The Small House of Uncle Thomas,"" choreographed by Jerome Robbins, is a wonderful introduction to ballet. For younger children, the film can serve as the occasion for discussions about the geography of Southeast Asia and Western imperialism in that region. As to U.S. history, the film provides a basis for talks about slavery in the United States, the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln and the role of the book Uncle Tom's Cabin in turning attitudes in the northern United States against slavery. The film can also be used to talk about the history of Siam in the colonial era.",nan,"MODERATE. ""The King and I"" is banned in Thailand because it presents a skewed view of King Mongkut and his accomplishments. King Mongkut and his son, King Chulalongkorn, are revered in Thailand for policies that modernized Siam and kept it from becoming a colony of some European power. King Mongkut was a very civilized and well educated man and the Thais are justly proud of him. ""The King and I"" is not about Siam, King Mongkut, or Prince Chulalongkorn. It's a musical entertainment based on Western perceptions of people in countries considered to be exotic or ""uncivilized."" This should be pointed out to children who see this film. It was not Anna Leonowens who was the driving force behind Siam's modernization. ""Anna"" was merely a teacher brought in as a small part of the overall strategy of King Mongkut. Again, this should be pointed out when showing the film. The final necessary correction to this film is that the presentation of Buddhism is grossly inaccurate. For example, Buddhists do not regard Buddha as a god, but rather as a teacher/therapist who recognized the cause of life's pain and despair and who then proposed the cure. See Learning Guide to ""Little Buddha"". Parenting Points:     Read about the real King Mongcut in the Helpful Background section and tell your child about him.",nan
253,Music of the Heart,A popular and innovative teacher of violin at mostly black and Hispanic elementary schools in New York City is laid off due to budget cuts. The teacher refuses to accept her fate and fade away. She and the parents of her students band together to raise money to pay her salary. Can they succeed? Will the public take notice and support their efforts? Or are these children doomed to be deprived of their beloved teacher and their hope for an education in music? The film was inspired by the achievements of Roberta Guaspari and her students in the East Harlem Violin Program.,pics/music-of-the-heart-DVDcover.jpg,,9,"""Music of the Heart"" has many strengths. It shows: young children eager to learn and practice the violin; caring and nurturing inner city schools; female role models; a dedicated teacher; a dedicated principal; a crippled child overcoming her handicaps; and people of all races in the melting pot of New York City, working together to raise their children. The experiences of Ms. Guaspari and her violin program demonstrate that people can, with luck, sometimes triumph over misguided government policies. ""Music of the Heart"" will also introduce children to Carnegie Hall and to some of the great violinists of our time. The movie contains an excellent subplot about the heroine and her children dealing with their husband/father's decision to divorce the heroine.",nan,"SERIOUS: We much prefer Small Wonders, a fascinating documentary about Ms. Guaspari and her young violin students. Because the documentary shows real elementary school students working hard in class and practicing at home, as well as the actual concert at Carnegie Hall, it is more interesting to both children and adults than the fictionalized version. In addition, it does not contain many of the possible problems of the fictionalized version. The best use of this film is as a refresher, to be shown several years after children are shown ""Small Wonders"" to remind them and to confirm the lessons of the documentary. Parents and teachers should think carefully before showing this film to children whose parents are divorced or separated. The heroine and her children can be seen as the victims of an uncaring husband/father who has run off with another woman without giving the family a decent chance. Young children whose parents are separated or divorced might think that this applies to their personal situation. In addition, parents and teachers should consider starting a discussion in which the following issues are raised: Are separation and divorce a matter of fault? Should adults who don't love each other stay together for the sake of the children or because of the sanctity of marriage? Do divorce and separation have anything to do with how much parents love their children or are they about relationships between adults? What are the responsibilities of adults who are divorced or separated and who don't have custody of their children? This discussion will prepare children for this film. Some parents may object to the presentation of marriage and sexual fidelity in the film. The heroine, after her husband leaves her for another woman, has secured a teaching job and brought her children to New York. She is staying temporarily at the apartment of a man she knew in high school. He wants to have a romantic relationship with her and tries to interest her in sleeping with him. She feels the same way but hesitates because she is still married. He persuades her by remarking that her husband, at that very moment, was with another woman. No graphic sexuality is displayed. We are shown only tender kisses and the heroine in bed alone, waking up the next morning, still under the covers apparently without any clothes on. The man is never shown in bed with her. Later the relationship develops into one in which she wants commitment but he doesn't, so she tells him she can't see him any more. The man expresses some immature feelings about marriage, asserting that since half of all marriages end in divorce, he doesn't want to try for a committed relationship.",nan
66,Camille,"It is France in the mid-nineteenth century. Marguerite, a beautiful courtesan, lives a life of extravagance, but she is ill with consumption, at that time an incurable disease. Marguerite has never known true love until she meets Armand, a young man who has applied to work in the foreign service. When Marguerite renounces her life in the demimonde and they announce their plans to marry, Marguerite receives a visit from Armand's father. He reminds her that if she and Armand are married, Armand's career will be doomed, and his sister excluded from ""good"" society. The father pleads with Marguerite to leave Armand. What will she do? What will Armand do? Benefits of the Movie: This film will introduce children to a classic story of love and tragedy. It is important for children to vicariously experience and work through the pain of lost love through stories such as ""Camille."" The movie is beautifully filmed and features Greta Garbo, a screen legend. Possible Problems:    MINOR. Some parents may not want their children exposed to the fact that an institution such as the demimonde existed. The film contains several scenes of drunken revelry.

Students who are not reading the novel will gain insight into World War I through the vivid imagery of trench warfare as well as through research and writing assignments at the film's end.,"Possible Problems: Moderate: This is a war film with hand to hand combat, injury, and death. Although there is little gore, the suffering of the soldiers is vivid.","Rationale for Using the Story: All Quiet on the Western Front shows the effects of the war on the individual soldier, whether friend or foe. It illustrates the horrors of war with specific reference to trench warfare during the First World War. It also shows the drawbacks of unquestioning patriotism. The effect is powerful in promoting an anti-war sentiment."
54,The Black Stallion,"A father and his ten-year-old son Alec are returning from Africa by sea. The ship burns and sinks in a storm. All on board are lost except Alec and a black Arabian stallion. Marooned on a deserted shore, the boy and the stallion save each other's lives and develop a strong attachment. After they are rescued, Alec and the horse are brought to Alec's home in California where the boy races the horse. The film is from the novel by Walter Farley. Benefits of the Movie: This is a visually exquisite movie which shows a beautiful and close relationship between a boy and a horse. It can also be used to introduce a child to Bucephalus, the quasi-mythical horse of Alexander the Great, and to horse racing. Possible Problems:    MINOR. While the ship is sinking, a passenger tries to steal Alec's life preserver by cutting the straps. Alec's father, who is trying to help save the ship, sees this attempt, rushes over, seizes the man and shoves his head into a porthole which is belching flame. The scene is brief and part of the pandemonium of the sinking ship. The viewer is not shown any gruesome effects of the fire on the man.

It also asserts that SeaWorld Entertainment (the operator of several marine mammal parks in the U.S.) misleads the public and that SeaWorld put its employees at risk by requiring them to perform with orcas. The film explores the circumstances of the 2010 killing of trainer Dawn Brancheau by the orca Tilikum which resulted in a citation by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) and an order requiring physical barriers between trainers and orcas.

The play served as the basis for the musical My Fair Lady.",pics/pygmalion-DVDcover.jpg,,12,"""Pygmalion"" describes how accent can determine social status and economic opportunity. It also provides an introduction to phonetics and to the Greek myth of Pygmalion. The movie allows children to work through the romantic situations of Eliza, Higgins and Eliza's friend, Freddie. Eliza demonstrates an inner strength that will not accept the limitations of a class system that denies the intrinsic value of the individual. Higgins, immersed in his studies, is blind to most human emotions. This black and white version is appropriate for older children who are studying drama, who love My Fair Lady, or who are studying Greek myths. Possible Problems:     MINOR. Alcohol use and smoking are shown. The ending in which Eliza returns to Higgins despite his insistence on treating her like a servant is problematic and may disappoint, if not infuriate, children who have been raised at a time when gender equality is assumed. George Bernard Shaw also had a problem with this ending and wrote a sequel to the play in which Eliza rejects Higgins and marries Freddie. See Sequel: What Happened Afterwards.",nan,"MINOR.

58,The Boy in the Striped Pajamas,"The time is WWII; the place, Germany. Bruno is an 8 year old boy whose father is promoted to be commandant of a death camp. The family lives in a luxurious house isolated in the country. The only person Bruno's age to play with is Shmuel, a boy behind the barbed wire of the camp. Bruno is told by his family that the camp is a farm and refers to the uniforms of the incarcerated Jews as ""striped pajamas."" Slowly and reluctantly he comes to know part of the truth about the camp and his father. Bruno's attempt to make up for an earlier betrayal of his friend causes Bruno to don the ""pajamas"" and sneak into the camp to help search for Shmuel's lost father. While Bruno's father frantically searches for his son, the boys are herded with a group of inmates into one of the gas chambers. Holding hands, they die together. This film is based on a work of historical fiction by Irish novelist John Boyne. Benefits of the Movie: This film presents a child's point of view of the Holocaust and serves as a valuable supplement for any study of Germany's effort to exterminate the Jews of Europe. The relationship between the two boys demonstrates the absurdity of judgments based on blood line. The innocence of childhood is a concept which dominates the movie and supports a perspective on the Holocaust that is important for a full understanding of German atrocities during the Second World War. Social Studies Classes: ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" is one of many films designed to make the Holocaust personal for today's students. It is not intended to reflect historical accuracy. Instead, it illuminates the following points about the events of the European theatre in WWII: The disregard for the plight of the Jews by common German people during the Holocaust; The denial process applied to the immorality of what Germany was doing to the Jews; The propaganda used in educating German children, including the propagation of anti-Semitism; The existence and suppression of dissenting points of view; (for more on this, see The White Rose); The callous and casual manner in which the Germans developed more efficient killing methods; The ironies involved in the failure to adhere to well-developed standards of ethics, such as in the treatment of children. The Discussion Questions provided in this Learning Guide will help explore these areas of focus. Suggested Research Assignments can be given to individuals or to groups of students. English Language Arts Classes: The film and the discussions suggested below will motivate students to apply themselves to essay and research assignments, encouraging them to practice several skills required by ELA Curriculum standards.

The village chorus gives James his instructions: ""come back and tell us about the place where our dream lies."" Once in Israel, diverted by the lures of materialism, James finds himself on a different and more important journey. The story is a charming parable about the limits of the profit motive and the need to find one's own holy place, despite the temptations of contemporary life. 

""James' Journey to Jerusalem"" is funny and affecting. The characters are well drawn, rounded, and complex. The acting and production values are excellent. The lilting, bittersweet African/Levantine flavors of Ehud Banay's prize-winning musical score add dimension and charm to the movie.",pics/james-journey-DVD_cover.jpg,,12,"""James' Journey to Jerusalem"" teaches an excellent lesson about the seduction of material culture and the importance of keeping sight of your goals. James' real journey is to unregulated, out of control capitalist materialism and back to a more balanced life of spiritualism, meaningful relationships, and trust. The over-arching theme of the movie is timeless and universal: everyone is on a journey to find what will make them truly happy, but many of us are lured away from our goal by one or more of the seductions of contemporary life (for example, money, material goods, alcohol, drugs, gambling, bad associations). To find fulfillment, we need to leave these behind and resume our journey. 

The movie is an Israeli exercise in self-criticism that has important lessons for any affluent capitalist society. It is especially relevant to those which benefit from immigrant labor (the U.S., Canada, and Western Europe). It also: (1) provides an opportunity to describe the differences between the great economic theories of the 19th and 20th centuries: capitalism, communism, and socialism; (2) serves as an antidote to white racism and class discrimination because the character the viewer identifies with is black and the viewer sees the world through his eyes; (3) introduces and explores the archetype of the pilgrimage; (4) is an excellent example of a parable; and (5) contains good examples of the literary devices of symbolism, irony, plot development, and character.",nan,"None.

As long as it is legal, as long as the wages paid the workers are fair, and if the interest charged on the bail money is reasonable, it's fine. The boss should also help those who want to get ahead acquire an education or a skill. See Discussion Question #11. This film is an indictment of materialism in Western civilization when it erodes other values. It is also an indictment of capitalism when it doesn't protect vulnerable workers. There is, however, another side to the tale. In the American Dream (and the Israeli Dream as well), the immigrant comes to the country and pays his passage. (Remember the years that immigrants to the American colonies endured in indentured servitude?) After a period of time the immigrant is free of these obligations and can strike out on his own to make a life for himself in the new land. See Discussion Question #3.",nan

At the same time, noted surgeon, Caldwell Esselstyn, also raised on a dairy farm, noticed that a year or two after he performed arterial by-pass surgery, the arteries of many of his patients were filled again with cholesterol.

86,Cool Runnings,"Bobsledding in Jamaica? They don't have any snow in Jamaica. This madcap comedy is based on the inspiring story of the bobsled team sent by Jamaica to the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Canada. Benefits of the Movie: ""Cool Runnings"" explores themes of perseverance against great odds, cheating, second chances, and developing self-esteem. It will introduce children to the Olympics and the island of Jamaica. The members of the bobsled team are role models for individuals determined to succeed. The coach is a role model for someone who has cheated, but having acknowledged his mistake, seeks a second chance. Possible Problems: MINOR.

22,Anne of Green Gables,"This movie is a warmhearted portrayal of the adolescence of an orphan girl after she finds a home with an elderly brother and sister. The action takes place on Prince Edward Island at the turn of the 20th century. The film is based on the classic novel by Lucy Maud Montgomery.

41,Beautiful Dreamers,"This film is a fictionalized account of a real-life friendship between Walt Whitman and Dr. Richard Bucke, the director of an insane asylum located in a small town in Canada. The conflicts faced as Dr. Bucke attempts to bring progressive treatment to those suffering from mental illness and neurological conditions, provide a context in which the value of Whitman's humanistic philosophy comes alive and the meaning of his poetry is enriched. Rip Torn's portrayal of Whitman is masterful. Benefits of the Movie: Students who have seen ""Beautiful Dreamers"" feel that they have a personal relationship with Walt Whitman, and they are interested in what he has to say. After they have seen this movie, students at all levels have an increased interest in reading Whitman's poetry. This movie is an excellent addition to any lesson plan on Whitman and his poetry. The film also shows the barbaric treatment of the mentally ill, the mentally handicapped and those with neurological conditions during the 1800s. Dr. Bucke was a pioneer in fashioning more humane and effective therapies for the mentally ill and neurologically afflicted. The techniques he developed stem directly from the idea that feeling underlies thought, a concept clearly illustrated in Whitman's poetry. Dr. Bucke serves as a model of courage and tolerance; he is a good and sensitive physician who is willing to risk disapproval by those in his community and his profession in order to improve the lives of his patients.",pics/beautiful-dreamers-VHScover.jpg,LT,12,"Students who have seen ""Beautiful Dreamers"" feel that they have a personal relationship with Walt Whitman, and they are interested in what he has to say.

Dr. Bucke's wife happens upon her husband and Whitman sitting naked by a lake smearing themselves with mud and singing opera. (Whitman was devoted to Italian opera.) When she arrives, the men immediately jump into the water to hide their nakedness. Emboldened by Whitman's poetry and to the further embarrassment of the men, the wife begins to disrobe. Whitman, the ""libertine,"" is so distressed by this that he swims away. We are shown a full frontal view of the wife's unclothed (and beautiful) body as she enters the water to swim with her husband. This scene relates to liberation of the spirit rather than sensuality, and it has been shown to many classes without ill effect. While there is much about this movie that is accurate, there are some historical inaccuracies. See Note on Historical Accuracy in the side bar. Parenting Points:     This movie will put a face and persona behind Walt Whitman's poetry. If your child is studying Whitman in English class, show this movie. It will help immensely.

27,Au Revoir Les Enfants,"It is 1944 in Nazi occupied France. Julien, age 12, has been sent to a boarding school run by an order of the Catholic Church. At the beginning of the semester three new boys come to the school and he befriends one of them. When the Gestapo arrives looking for Jewish children being hidden from the Nazis Julien is suddenly forced into a world beyond his childhood innocence. The film is derived from an incident that occurred when the writer/director, Louis Malle (1932-2005), was a child in boarding school in Nazi occupied France. Benefits of the Movie:     ""Au Revoir Les Enfants"" is an excellent coming of age film. It contrasts true growth (that comes from confrontation with real events) with the artificial means that adolescent boys use to appear ""grown up"" (smoking, making disparaging remarks about what are described as pictures of naked women, swearing). The movie shows several aspects of the German occupation of France during WWII and of the Holocaust. It demonstrates that in tight situations, one innocent automatic reaction can lead to disaster. This film also raises interesting ethical issues concerning punishment for infractions and collaboration with the enemy during war. Possible Problems:     MINOR. This film contains some mild profanity. The smoking and other actions by the children to appear more sophisticated (see above) are shown as a shallow and not particularly attractive.",pics/au-revoir-les-enfants-VHScover.jpg,HT,11,"""Au Revoir Les Enfants"" is an excellent coming of age film.

Some of the dialogue with the Apaches is in Spanish.",nan,MINOR. The fight with the Apaches is not entirely realistic. They didn't fight en mass as shown in the movie.

87,Coppelia,"Set in a Polish village at the end of the 18th century, this ballet classic follows the romantic high jinks of sweethearts Franz and Swanhilda. The young lovers are drawn into mischief by their fascination with the ""daughter"" of the mysterious doll maker, Dr. Coppelius. She appears only in the window of Dr. Coppelius' shop, facing the village square, where the young people dance. Seated in a chair, Coppelia appears to be always reading a book. Franz is attracted to this new creature. Swanhilda observes his fascination and senses a rival. They resolve, separately, to investigate. In the workshop of Coppelius, each finds more and less than he or she expected. There are marvelous mechanical dolls that dance when touched. The doddering doctor invites Franz to drink with him and secretly puts a sleeping potion in the wine. Then, using magic incantations from an old book, he tries to draw the life force from Franz and transfer it to his adored creation Coppelia. Swanhilda obliges with an impersonation of the doll come to life. This is comic rather than menacing, with very readable pantomime moving the action along. The ballet concludes with a festive village wedding for the young pair. Folk dances (czardas and mazurka) enliven the classical ballet vocabulary. The music is by Leo Delibes. This ballet is fun for the whole family, and deserves a wider audience. Most current productions are updated versions of the 19th century choreography of Arthur Saint-Leon and the grand master Marius Petipa. For example, the Fernando Bujones version, which showcases this dancer's virtuosity, adds more dancing for Franz. The story line is based on ETA Hoffmann's tale, ""Der Sandmann.""",pics/coppelia-DVDcover.jpg,,5,Parenting Points:,nan,"Minor. The girls use a key that Dr. Coppelius has dropped to gain entrance to the shop without his permission. Franz climbs in through a window. Franz accepts wine from a stranger, Dr. Coppelius. But this is all obviously fantasy, and parents who wish can turn these into benefits by simply pointing out to children, after the dance is over, that it is not a good idea to take food, candy or drink from strangers and that these kids were very lucky that they were able to escape from Coppelius without injury or being hauled off to jail.",nan

310,Remember the Titans,"Description: This film chronicles true events that occurred during1971 in Alexandria, Virginia, when the school board came under court order to integrate both faculty and students in the public schools. At the time, high school football was the city's most popular sport. The Titans become a model of integration for a city in troubled times. The film combines four stories: (1) the time-tested formula of the triumph of an underdog sports team; (2) the friendship between the two coaches, the black head coach and his white assistant, despite the fact that many thought that the white coach's experience and years of service meant that he should be the head coach; (3) the friendship of two players, Gerry Bertier, the white team captain, and Julius Campbell, a talented black player; and (4) the story of a racially divided team coming together and playing as a unit despite the racial hatred roiling the community around it. The story of the underdog sports team is an invention of the filmmakers. Once the team coalesced at training camp, they were favored and had only one close game in their regular season. The important stories, those of the two coaches and the two players are true although many specific facts may have been supplied by the script writer. The two coaches were lifelong friends, as were the two players. The team pulled together despite the racial tensions.",pics/remember-the-titans-DVDcover.jpg,,11,nan,Objectives/Student Outcomes Using this Learning Guide: Students can exercise writing and research skills through assignments at the film's end which include the role played by both high school and professional sports in the Civil Rights Movement.,"Possible Problems: Minor racial violence is shown.

A major character is critically injured in a car accident.",Rationale for Using the Movie: Remember the Titans is useful in clarifying the shifts in attitudes and the various personal decisions that were an important part of the progress in the early days of the process of integrating public schools in the South.

On his way he meets Ann Taylor, a New York attorney, and Dr. Marshall, a local naturalist, who are lost in the bush.

The film contains beautiful photography of the African landscape, its skies, and its animals. Xixo is a role model for a good father and a competent, compassionate man. Dr. Marshall, the naturalist, is also a good man. Possible Problems:    MODERATE: The most disturbing thing about this film is its cavalier attitude toward the use of guns.

Your child should know that this was a break-through movie when it was released and that it was part of a national dialogue about race. The actors and actresses in the film were very popular at the time, a fact that helped give the film credibility. You may want to talk to your child about inter-racial dating or even inter-racial friendships that may be occurring in your child's school or social life.

102,Dear Frankie,"Frankie is nine years old and deaf; he lives in Scotland with his mother and grandmother. As the movie opens, the family has just moved again. Frankie doesn't know why his family moves so frequently, nor does the audience, but it is slowly revealed that they are fleeing from domestic violence. To protect her son from the brutal truth and to provide him with a semblance of a nurturing father, Frankie's mother claims that his father is absent because he works as a merchant seaman on a ship named the Accra. Frankie has kept up a lively correspondence with his dad. However, Frankie's mother has been intercepting the boy's letters and writing responses, always signing, ""Love, Dad."" The deception threatens to unravel when the Accra actually docks at the seaport in the family's new home town. Frankie is overjoyed and tells his classmates that he'll soon see his father. One of the boys doubts this and Frankie bets his prized stamp collection that his father will show up when the Accra comes into port. Frankie's ever resourceful mother decides to hire a man to pose as Frankie's father. The moment is complicated by the fact that Frankie's real father, on his deathbed, has found the family and wants to see his son before he dies. This is a delightful and warmhearted film that will touch both children and adults. Benefits of the Movie: This film will be helpful in Health and ELA classes.

103,Degas and the Dancer,"The time is the late 19th century. A friend brings Edgar Degas to the ballet school of the Paris Opéra to make sketches for a book. Degas, initially skeptical, becomes fascinated with drawing and painting the young dancers. Later, he hires one to be a model. As the movie unfolds, both she and Degas suffer a crisis of confidence, doubting their talent. Through their friendship they help each other to overcome their fears and continue, in her case to dance, and in his case to paint.

121,Ever After,"""Ever After"" is an enchanting re-imagining of the Cinderella fairy tale set in France during the Renaissance. In this version the little cinder girl is a well-read young woman of passionate intelligence and integrity named Danielle. She awakens a jaded prince of France by advocating concepts from Sir Thomas More's Utopia. The Prince, it turns out, is suffocating in the gilded cage of royal life. In a charming departure from the plot of the classic tale, the cinder girl saves the Prince just as much as he saves her. 

Leonardo da Vinci, who served as artist in residence at the French court from 1516 to 1519, acts out the role of fairy godmother. The Mona Lisa and several of his famous inventions make cameo appearances. This is a very literate tale, told with great wit and charm.",pics/ever-after-DVDcover.jpg,HT,10,"This movie is an effortlessly feminist take on a beloved story. Danielle is a wonderful role model for any young woman: intellectually vibrant, loyal, courageous, and tender-hearted. 

Students can move from ""Ever After"" to a study of the original Cinderella, and the role of fairy and folk tales in helping children deal with the developmental issues involved in growing up, leaving home, meeting the world's challenges, and reaching authentic maturity. See Fairy Tales: A Vital Literary Genre for Children 

""Ever After"" also introduces children to the new world of social thought that was dawning in Europe during the Renaissance. See The Renaissance. The genius of Leonardo is highlighted in a lighthearted manner as his character wanders into the action from the periphery and then champions the match of Danielle and the Prince. Leonardo tries to walk on water in his boat shoes, agrees to critique the work of a young painter, and mentions that Michelangelo is stuck under a ceiling in Rome (the Sistine Chapel). Danielle flies a kite of Leonardo's design. See section of this Guide on Leonardo.",nan,"MINIMAL. There are a number of historical errors in the film.

Parenting Points:     Chances are good that this play will be a part of your child's high school English course of study. He or she will benefit from seeing the film either before or after reading the play since Shakespeare's language is often difficult for young readers and the film helps them understand the themes. Plays were not intended to be read; they were to be seen and experienced through the skills of the actors. The Helpful Background information should be of use to your child in his or her efforts to complete assignments required by the teacher or simply to clarify the times and the conflicts about which Shakespeare wrote. Ask and help your child to answer the Quick Discussion Questions. Helpful Background: Rome grew from a small village along the Tiber River into an empire that, at its height, ruled the civilized Western world. The Roman Empire included most of Europe, the Middle East, Egypt and North Africa. The Romans had a genius for organization, administration, construction and warfare. They were industrious and disciplined. From approximately 500 B.C.E. to 31 B.C.E. Rome was a republic. Two administrators, called praetors and later consuls, were elected each year by the citizens. There was constant friction between the common people (the plebeians) and the wealthy aristocracy (the patricians). Gradually the Roman Senate became the province of the aristocracy and the most powerful arm of the government. Roman farmers were increasingly dispossessed by the consolidation of smaller farms into large estates. They moved to the cities, many of them to Rome, where conditions began to deteriorate. In 87 B.C.E. Marius, a leader of the Plebeian party, massacred senators and other patricians. Sulla, a general who was a champion of the patricians, marched on Rome with 40,000 troops in 83 B.C.E. That was the first occasion on which Roman Legions entered Rome. Thereafter the city and the empire would be hostage to whichever general could muster the most troops. Sulla ruled as dictator for four years, until 79 B.C.E.",nan

111,Music as a Human and Cultural Right using Clips from Dr. Sarmast's Music School,"The Taliban forbade music from 1996 to 2001 when they ruled Afghanistan, except for religious songs and Taliban ""chants"". As the movie opens Kabul has been freed from Taliban oppression and Dr. Ahmad Sarmast, the only Afghan ever to earn a doctorate in music, returns from exile in Australia. His goal is nothing less than to revive the musical traditions of Afghanistan. He also wants to re-introduce Western music. To fulfill these goals, Dr. Sarmast establishes the Afghan National Institute of Music (ANIM). Dr. Sarmast insists that some of the students come from the population of disadvantaged young people who make their living selling small items on the streets of Kabul and that as many girls as possible come to the school. This inspiring documentary recounts Dr. Sarmast's efforts. The two suggested videos from other sources set the musical context and show a concert by the ANIM orchestra on its tour of the U.S. in early 2013, after the film was completed.",pics/dr-sarmasts-music-school-poster.jpg,,12,nan,"Students will learn that there are places where it is a crime to play or sing music and that some people take great risks to keep musical traditions alive. Students will be introduced to the Afghanistan war, the concept that the right to play and hear music is a basic human right, the traditional music of Afghanistan, the orchestral composition",nan,"It is helpful to expand the horizons of students, to show them cultures and places that are different from those they have experienced, that freedoms which they take for granted, such as the right to hear and play music, are not available everywhere, and that sometimes basic human rights can only be secured through tremendous effort and great risk."
108,A Dry White Season,"The setting is South Africa during the Soweto uprisings of 1976. A white school teacher (Ben du Toit) investigates the death of his black gardener, a man he had known for 15 years. The gardener (Gordon Ngubene) had been searching for answers about his son's death while in police custody. This had brought Ngubene to the attention of the ""Special Branch"" of the South African Police. He suffered the same fate as his son: death during interrogation. Du Toit comes to realize not only the injustices of the apartheid legal system and the repressive policies that supported it, but the necessity of action as opposed to words or resignation to the inevitable. Backed by an African cabbie, a liberal lawyer and a persistent reporter, he is opposed by his family (except for his young son), his school and his community. The film is based on the novel by the acclaimed Afrikaaner writer, André Brink. The novel was banned by the apartheid government of South Africa. Benefits of the Movie:     ""A Dry White Season"" shows that sometimes, no matter what the cost and no matter how futile it may seem, one must take action to oppose injustice. The film also explores the personal cost of resisting injustice that is accepted by one's community and maintained by a repressive government. It will introduce the now abandoned apartheid system of South Africa, the Special Branch (secret police), economic and political oppression of the townships (Bantu System), and the arguments used by to justify apartheid.",pics/dry-white-season-VHScover.jpg,,14,"""A Dry White Season"" shows that sometimes, no matter what the cost and no matter how futile it may seem, one must take action to oppose injustice.

After escaping from Germany to Russian occupied Poland, Solly was placed in a Soviet orphanage where he joined the Komsomol, the Communist youth organization.

One of the bonding moments in the movie occurs when her friends try to help her decide not to commit suicide.",Rationale for Using the Movie: Empire Records is a great reward film because it is immensely entertaining and shows the power of friendship and nurturing. Empire Records can also be used to drive writing assignments in an ELA class.

135,Fly Away Home,"In Fly Away Home, a 13-year-old girl whose mother has died in a car accident must now live with her long estranged father. He brings her to his home in Canada where she must grieve her loss and adjust to living with a father she barely knows. The film uses the beauty of nature and an orphaned gaggle of goslings to illustrate the process through which the daughter heals. The movie also describes how the father learns be a good parent. The action of the film is based on the discovery by a Canadian named Bill Lishman that ultralight aircraft can be used to reintroduce migratory patterns in species of birds. Based on this framework, the filmmakers have built a delightful story with important lessons about life.",pics/fly-away-home-dvd-cover.jpg,BL,10,"Health Classes — This film offers a look at how focusing on nature, a supportive family, and a project that takes an individual outside of oneself can serve the process of grieving. It provides a dramatic example for a lesson in healthy ways of dealing with loss. See Using Fly Away Home in Health Classes. The movie also addresses the redemption of a neglectful parent who comes to learn the importance of his role in the life of his daughter. 

English Language Arts Classes — Fly Away Home is useful in inspiring students to exercise writing skills required by the ELA curriculum. See Using Fly Away Home in ELA Classes. See also, Movie Lesson Plan for: The Hero's Journey in Fly Away Home — Teaching the Journey and Its Archetypes Through Quests for Internal Growth and Environmental Achievement in a Popular Film With a Young Heroine. 

Biology Classes — The movie can serve as a springboard for discussions about migration and its inverse, dormancy, although for many classes, a portion of the film ""Winged Migration"" will better serve the purpose. Fly Away Home will also serve to introduce students to innovative efforts to repair damage to the environment. See Using Fly Away Home in Biology Classes.",nan,"The film takes the position that bending the rules and breaking the law is justified if the perpetrators are well-intentioned. This weakness can be turned into a strength through comment and discussion. See Discussion Question #11. The father becomes a better parent through the story, but some would question many of his parenting practices. See Discussion Questions 6 and 14. Young viewers may be disturbed by the auto accident shown at the film's opening and the images of a young girl grieving. The character of the father, an artist who enjoys the risky sport of hang-gliding, can seem reckless in his willingness to allow his daughter to fly an ultralight aircraft alone, but she had trained rigorously for the experience and succeeds admirably. Parenting Points:     Enjoy this film with your children. During the movie you might remark that a Canadian named Bill Lishman discovered that ultralight aircraft could be used to help geese and other birds re-establish their migration routes. The technique is now used as far away as Siberia. After the film is over, remark on how Amy was able to get over her grief. She went to nature and, after a while, she allowed others to comfort her. Also, Amy undertook a major project that allowed her to commit to something in the future, rather than simply looking back at the past. You can also point out how the movie shows Amy learning to take care of her motherless goslings while Tom, her father, is learning to take care of his motherless daughter. You may want to comment on the fallacy of the film's position that bending the rules and breaking the law is justified if the perpetrators are well-intentioned. Should your children be interested in migration, show them the first 45 minutes of ""Winged Migration"". The entire film is too long for most kids. For an in-depth analysis of migration, see TWM's Lesson Plan on Migration, Nomadism and Dormancy.",nan
335,Sense and Sensibility,"This film is an adaptation of Jane Austen's classic novel about the role of romance and money in English upper class society of the 19th century. Benefits: This film is an excellent introduction to Jane Austen's classic novel Sense and Sensibility. Austen's works are not easy for even the most advanced readers. A college level teacher has reported that her students are more interested in reading Sense and Sensibility after they have seen the film. In addition, when tested against a control group who only read the book, students who had seen the film before reading the novel had a better understanding of the characters and the plot. (See ""Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility as Gateway to Austen's Novel"" from Jane Austen in Hollywood, Edited by Linda Troost and Sayre Greenfield, 1998, University of Kentucky Press, pages 140 - 147.) Possible Problems: MINOR. The portrayal of the male characters in the film is different than in the novel. See Helpful Background Section below. Parenting Points:     Review the Helpful Background Section and talk to your child about Jane Austen's portrayal of men in her book and the portrayal of men in the movie. Pay particular attention to the changes in the society shown by these differences.

337,Shakespeare Behind Bars,"Description: Murderers, thieves and a child abuser, in prison on long sentences, seek self-discovery by playing roles in a production of Shakespeare's great last play, The Tempest. Since actors in Elizabethan times were considered to be criminal low life, Shakespeare would feel right at home with this troupe. As they prepare for performance, the men reflect on their crimes and the meaning of forgiveness while discovering remarkable parallels between their own lives and the experiences of the characters they play.",pics/shakespeare-behind-bars-DVDcover.jpg,,14,nan,"Objectives/Student Outcomes Using this Learning Guide: Careful consideration of this documentary will lead students to examine the sometimes tenuous connection between remorse, repentance and future action; challenge stereotypes about prisoners, and raise issues society must wrestle with regarding incarceration. Several research topics for expository essays are suggested. Students will have a greater appreciation for Shakespeare's The Tempest.",Possible Problems: None.,"Rationale for Using the Movie: The film shows how Shakespeare is still relevant today. It builds upon, modernizes and extends themes in The Tempest. It upends many of the assumptions viewers might have about violent criminals. This racially mixed group of inmates are perceptive, funny, engaging, articulate, and seemingly remorseful. An update on the prisoners' status at the film's conclusion is startling. In spite of their seeming self-awareness and capacity for growth, some of the central subjects do not do well after the movie is completed. One tragic occurrence is listed in the update. It puts a human face on the hotly debated issue of sentencing young offenders to life in prison without the possibility of parole. This movie demonstrates the continuing relevance of Shakespeare to contemporary life, and can be a source of inspiration for students. The film can be used as an interesting introduction to The Tempest or as a follow-up after studying the play. Shakespeare Behind Bars is also useful on its own."
47,Beyond Rangoon,"This film was inspired by the sad and continuing history of political repression in Myanmar (formerly Burma). It tells the fictional story of Dr. Laura Bowman, an American who travels to Myanmar as a tourist, seeking to forget a tragedy at home. Confronted with the searing brutality of the ruling military dictatorship, she is transformed by the suffering of the Burmese people and the inspiring leadership of Nobel Peace Prize Winner Aung San Suu Kyi. To this day, Aung San Suu Kyi and the movement she heads seek democracy and a government that recognizes basic human rights.",pics/beyond-rangoon-VHScover.jpg,HT,14,"""Beyond Rangoon"" allows the viewer to experience a conflict that is unknown to most of the world. Because the Myanmar military has imposed a virtual news blackout on the country, few images of its brutal repression have reached the international media. Having an outsider ""witness"" the atrocities helps non-Burmese relate to this far away conflict. But this film is not solely devoted to human rights abuses in Myanmar. It also shows how a person can overcome a devastating tragedy and become involved in life again. Possible Problems: SERIOUS. This is a film about a brutal civil war with shootings and beatings, but the violence is not played up to thrill the audience. A rape is contemplated, but does not get very far. Parenting Points:     As of 2006, Myanmar is still engulfed in its nightmare of tyranny. Check the Internet for articles about recent events, and describe them to your child. Ask and take your child through the answer to the Quick Discussion Question.",nan,"SERIOUS.

40,Beau Geste,"Three orphaned brothers from an upper class English family suddenly join the French Foreign Legion, usually the refuge of men with a past that they want to forget. What is their dark secret? Does it have anything to do with the large sapphire that was the bulk of their family's fortune? Benefits of the Movie: This movie presents an example of family loyalty, self-sacrifice and honor. It also provides an introduction to the French Foreign Legion, colonialism, British class structure in the 19th century, and how addiction causes hurt and injury to others. Possible Problems: MODERATE: Smoking and alcohol use and abuse are shown. The first scene, one of the most striking in all of film, shows a deserted fortress in the middle of the desert manned by dead soldiers propped against the battlements so that they appear to be standing and pointing their rifles outward. The corpses give the eerie impression that the fort is defended. This scene stays with people all of their lives and may be upsetting to sensitive children.",pics/beau-geste-VHScover.jpg,,12,"This movie presents an example of family loyalty, self-sacrifice and honor.

By showing a sterile civilization in which freedom of thought is taboo and reading books a crime, the film helps children understand the value of books and the benefits of liberty. The role of television and drugs as a means of keeping people focused on thoughtless entertainment is also explored by this movie. (Good readers ages 12 and up should be encouraged to read the book before or after the film. This story merits both reading the book and seeing the movie.)",nan,MINOR. The hero turns his flame thrower on the captain of the fire company.

137,A Force More Powerful,"This documentary chronicles the rise of nonviolent direct action by large numbers of people as a force for political and social change. The movie provides six examples in which nonviolent direct action changed the history of the 20th century. A Force More Powerful can serve as the basis for a two or three week unit exploring nonviolent direct action as a force for political and social change. The movie comes in six separate sections. Teachers can select the sections that would provide the most assistance in their classes. For example, the first two sections, dealing with the Nashville sit-ins and the movement seeking independence in India, are an excellent supplement to a unit on the U.S. Civil Rights Movement or for a class in government/civics. The sections on the Indian independence movement, Solidarity's challenge to Poland's communist government, and the defeat of Pinochet in Chile are an excellent capstone for a contemporary World History class.",pics/force-mp-gandhi_and_crowd.jpg,HT,12,"This documentary graphically demonstrates that as war has become more violent and the means of communication more effective, people have adapted by developing a new political force of immense power: nonviolent direct action (also called ""civil disobedience,"" and ""non-violent resistance"" or ""civil resistance""). This film shows the modern origins of the new political/social force by Mohandas K. Gandhi in South Africa and India. It describes other examples of nonviolent direct action at work. Nonviolent direct action continues to be a major source of progressive political and social change throughout the world. TeachWithMovies.com believes that no student will have a good grasp of world or U.S. history without an understanding of this new tactic for social and political change. A Force More Powerful provides its own historical background. Our independent research has confirmed many of the historical facts presented by the movie. This Learning Guide will provide additional interesting background on the situations featured in the film. The story of the Nashville sit-ins and Mr. James Lawson is particularly relevant to U.S. students. See We Were Warriors -- Nashville 1960. Another important benefit of the film is that at least two of the major actors were relatively young when they served as leaders of nonviolent direct action campaigns. James Lawson was 30 years old and Mkhuseli Jack an activist in South Africa was 27. Note: There is a very helpful website from the filmmakers with three lesson plans and other resources. The TWM Learning Guide to A Force More Powerful has been designed to supplement the lesson plans on the filmmakers' website. For example, the filmmakers do not provide suggested answers to their proposed discussion questions. This Learning Guide recasts those discussion questions, supplements them, and provides suggested answers. The Historical Background contained in this Learning Guide does not duplicate the background provided by the movie or the filmmakers on their website, but adds important and interesting facts. For example, in Chile, Augusto Pinochet did not simply disappear after his defeat in the plebiscite described in the film.

149,A Gentleman's Agreement,"The year is 1947. Phil Green, a journalist, has been hired by a popular magazine to write a series of articles about anti-Semitism in the U.S. He decides to pretend that he is Jewish and to record the reactions of the people he meets. While preparing the series, Phil meets Kathy Lacey, the niece of his publisher. It was Kathy who had initially proposed the series of articles that Phil is writing. She and Phil fall in love, but they find that Kathy has subtle and previously hidden anti-Semitic feelings. These are unacceptable to Phil who believes that prejudice in all its forms is evil. The film is the story of Phil's experiences in writing the series and how he and Kathy try to resolve their differences. ""Gentleman's Agreement"" is based on the novel by Laura Z. Hobson. The book was initially serialized in the magazine Cosmopolitan. Benefits of the Movie:     The lessons of this film are not limited to anti-Semitism but apply to any type of prejudice. It builds on our empathy with Phil, the crusading journalist, and Kathy, a woman torn between the attitudes of her class and what she knows is right. We are led to respect and like them both. As Kathy discovers her own prejudice, we come to understand how easily bigotry and insensitivity can creep into our own attitudes. When Phil makes it clear that he will not marry Kathy unless she changes, we empathize with her struggle to rid herself of prejudice. When she triumphs, we are shown that like Kathy, we can eliminate prejudice in ourselves. Because of its skillful use of a dramatic device to help its viewers to grow, mature and reconcile inconsistent parts of their own personalities, ""Gentleman's Agreement"" rates as one of the best films ever made. If children can be helped to see the film in this way, ""Gentleman's Agreement"" becomes an emotion picture that speaks to the intelligent heart of the viewer. It is likely to add significant memories to the fund of experience which is used by each viewer to understand his or her universe and to determine future actions.

Each version of the film has a slightly different focus and its own strengths and weaknesses. The 1951 version is probably best for children. It is in color, the plot is tighter (focusing on the tragic life of Julie LaVerne), the dancing is excellent, and there are fewer dated scenes. However, the 1936 version is preferred by many. It makes the black characters (Joe and Queenie) into real people and features Paul Robeson singing his incomparable rendition of ""Ol' Man River."" The story revolves around life on a stern wheeler which plies the Mississippi River giving performances at each stop. One of the performers is a mulatto woman seeking to pass as white. The characters have trouble with alcohol and gambling addiction. The Broadway musical ""Show Boat"" was adapted from a novel of the same name by Edna Ferber. Benefits of the Movie:     The songs in this musical are beautiful. It also raises the issues of dysfunctional romantic relationships, alcoholism, gambling addiction, and prejudice against interracial marriage. The musical can also serve to introduce children to the Mississippi River. Possible Problems:     1936 Version: MINOR. Drinking alcohol to excess is shown without substantial negative comment.

In this film children will be introduced to his life story. The movie also describes the infamous Dreyfus Affair in which the French Army General Staff mistakenly blamed a high-level security leak on its only Jewish member and sentenced him to life in prison on Devil's Island. When the Army came upon evidence that a mistake had been made, the General Staff refused to acknowledge its error but rather collaborated with the real spy to cover up the mistake. In its treatment of the Dreyfus affair, the movie poses the question: ""Is the suffering of one obscure person worth the disturbance of a great country?"" Finally, the movie shows how Zola died from a carbon monoxide leak in his stove and provides a basis to explain the danger of carbon monoxide poisoning. Frank S. Nugent of the New York Times described this film as ""Rich, dignified, honest and strong, it is at once the finest historical film ever made and the greatest screen biography ...."" There may have been other great biographical films since Mr. Nugent wrote his review, such as ""Gandhi"" or ""Michael Collins"", but they all trace their artistic inspiration to ""The Life of Emile Zola.""",nan,"MINOR.

142,Fruitvale Station,"Description: Fruitvale Station presents a fictionalized version of the last day in the life of Oscar Grant III, a 22 year-old African American from the San Francisco Bay area. In the early morning hours of New Years Day 2009, as a result of failing to cooperate with the police when placed under arrest and when he didn't promptly comply with the officer's order to present his arms so that he could be handcuffed, Mr. Grant was shot in the back by a police officer. Mr. Grant died a few hours later. The police officer was prosecuted for second degree murder but convicted only of involuntary manslaughter, which is defined as unintentionally wrongfully causing the death of another. California Penal Code § 192(b). The jury found that the prosecution had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the police officer had intended to kill Mr. Grant. Apparently the jury gave some credit to officer's claim that in the confusion of the situation, he mistakenly thought he had pulled out his taser, instead of his gun. In other words, the jury found that Mr. Grant was wrongfully killed but that the government hadn't proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing was not the result of a tragic mistake, as the police officer claimed.",pics/fruitvale-station-dvd-cover.jpg,,14,nan,"Objectives/Student Outcomes Using this Learning Guide: Students will have increased empathy for victims of violence, including police violence. Students will understand that since the judgment centers of the human brain are not fully developed until age 25, they must be careful to control their emotions during times of stress, especially when dealing with the police. Students will discuss and write about the importance of due process in police/citizen interactions.","Possible Problems: Other than the killing of Mr. Grant, there are no problems with this movie for a high school audience.","Rationale for Using the Movie: The film humanizes Mr. Grant by showing the last day of his life and his tragic killing. This is a helpful lesson for those who harbor conscious or unconscious racist feelings or who feel threatened by young black men. In addition to humanizing victims of police violence, the movie is an excellent platform for teaching students about the pitfalls of failing to cooperate with the police and that people who resist arrest should not be shot, unless they threaten to injure officers or others."

At the beginning of the story, Luis feels alienated from his father who he sees as foreign and embarrassing. Luis is flirting with joining a gang. Carlos, striving for the American Dream, borrows money from his sister who is also living in the U.S. He uses the money to buy a truck and the gardening business of his employer, who has saved enough money to retire to Mexico. When the truck is stolen, Carlos and his son team up to look for the thief, growing closer in the process.

Fertilized embryos are selected and altered for intelligence, strength, resistance to disease, and physical appearance. (The genetic counselor tells parents ""It's still you, simply the best of you."") Children conceived in the normal way, ""faith babies,"" are treated as second class citizens and relegated to menial jobs. ""Gattaca"" is a multifaceted film. It's the story of Vincent, a ""faith baby"" with strong will power who dreams of exploring space but lives in a world where only the genetically enhanced can be astronauts. Undaunted, Vincent pursues his dream in the only way possible. Jerome is the opposite. Blessed with the improvements offered by genetic engineering, he is unable to cope with the disappointments of life. ""Gattaca"" is also a murder mystery. Vincent gets caught up in the investigation surrounding the killing of his superior at work, a man who opposed the mission that Vincent has been scheduled to take. Is Vincent the murderer? Will the investigation expose Vincent as an ""in-valid"" and a ""de-gene-erate?""

145,Galileo: On the Shoulders of Giants,"This film is one of the Inventors' Specials, an award-winning series designed to introduce children to great scientists and inventors. The story centers on a fictionalized presentation of the relationship between Galileo and his student, Cosimo de Medici II, Grand Duke of Tuscany. Major events in Galileo's career are also depicted in the film. The movie describes many of the important scientific advances made by Galileo, including the discovery of inertia and that the motion of bodies can be the result of two different forces acting on them simultaneously. Galileo was also the first to observe that bodies of different weight fall to earth at the same speed. He improved the telescope and pioneered its use for astronomical investigation.",pics/galileo-inventors.jpg,PH,8,"""Galileo: On the Shoulders of Giants"" will acquaint children with Galileo Galilei, his discoveries, and his time. It is chock full of delightfully presented lessons in physics, astronomy, the scientific method, and history.",nan,"None. Parenting Points:     Tell your child that Galileo Galilei (1564 - 1642) is regarded by many as the founder of modern science. Before his time, knowledge of the physical world was based on the teachings of religion and the observations and untested theories of Aristotle and other Greek philosophers. Galileo insisted on verifying theory with experiments. He recognized that mathematics was the language through which nature could be explained. He improved the telescope and turned it to the heavens, which had been previously thought of as the realm of God. He saw mountains and valleys on the earth's moon and that Jupiter has its own moons. He saw millions of stars that could not be seen with the naked eye. Galileo's discoveries include the law of inertia and the law of motion that bodies fall toward the earth at the same rate despite differences in weight. He discovered that the motion of bodies can be the result of two different forces acting upon them. Tell your child that Galileo's discoveries thrilled the known world and he was considered a great scientist during his life. However, his discoveries made the Catholic Church very nervous. Galileo was investigated by the Inquisition for heresy several times and finally he was required to recant some of his findings. Because of his stature as a scientist, the Inquisition could not burn him at the stake. He lived the end of his life under house arrest for the crime of trying to describe how nature worked.",nan
147,Gandhi,"This is a biography of Mahatma Gandhi, the Indian social reformer whose invention, nonviolent mass action, changed the face of the 20th century. The movie shows the tremendous power of nonviolent mass action, the struggle for Indian independence, Gandhi's saintliness (and some of his unsaintly qualities), the difficulties caused by the Hindu/Muslim rivalry in India, the operation of the British Empire in India, the discrimination against Indians in South Africa, and Gandhi's efforts to improve Indian civil rights in South Africa.",pics/gandhi-DVDcover.jpg,HT,10,"Gandhi would neither countenance the subjugation of his people nor demean himself by hurting another human being. To reconcile these moral imperatives, he used nonviolent mass action, including civil disobedience, to force governments to change their policies and to achieve independence for India. Gandhi's methods have been adapted and used by people seeking social change or revolution in many parts of the world, including the U.S. Civil Rights Movement and revolutions in the Philippines, Russia and several other countries. This film is an excellent way to put the struggle for civil rights in the U.S. into a historical context as an example of a new method by which the powerless can force political and social change: nonviolent mass action. The documentary A Force More Powerful, which gives six examples of nonviolent mass action and explores the scope of Gandhi's influence, is an excellent companion film. Gandhi also campaigned for Hindu/Muslim brotherhood, against oppression of the untouchables, and for reform in the treatment of women. He was personally responsible for saving hundreds of thousands of lives in India through fasting which stopped communal rioting. Gandhi treated animals with kindness and consideration. He was a vegetarian, refusing to kill animals for food. Gandhi's leadership and example inspired people and many governments, in India and throughout the world, to a new and higher level of morality. Possible Problems:    MODERATE. There are isolated scenes of men and women being hit, clubbed and shot by policemen, soldiers and rioters.

348,Spare Parts,"Description: Born in Mexico, raised in Phoenix in impoverished homes, under constant threat of deportation, four undocumented students from Carl Hayden High School entered the 2004 Marine Advanced Technology Education Robotics Competition. Having little money for materials, their robot was an eclectic mix of PVC pipe and off-the-shelf motors, including the last minute addition of tampons to absorb water leaking into the circuitry. They entered the college division because they figured it would be less humiliating to come in last when competing against colleges than it would be to come in last against other high schools. To everyone's surprise, the students from Carl Hayden won, beating out MIT and all the other colleges that entered the competition. These movies tell their story. Spare Parts is a fictional, ""based on real events,"" version that was adapted from the Wired Magazine Article, ""La Vida Robot"" by Joshua Davis. (Mr. Davis has expanded the article into a charming book, also entitled Spare Parts.) Underwater Dreams is a documentary that also describes what happened to the Carl Hayden robotics club and its students in the decade after the competition.

Underwater Dreams has no possible problems; however, adults who present this film to students should know that it takes a strong stand in support of legislation to legalize the ""Dreamers"" and keep them in this country.","Rationale for Using the Movies: These films, like Stand and Deliver, show disadvantaged Hispanic kids from poor neighborhoods, sparked by inspiring teachers, performing amazing feats beyond all expectations. They are inspirational for all students. The movies show that with hard work, any barrier, including the difficulties imposed by an impoverished background can be overcome. Spare Parts can be used as an example of historical fiction. Underwater Dreams can be used as an example of a documentary. The films also raise the issue of the Dreamers, kids illegally smuggled to the U.S. by their parents and who grow up as Americans. Before President Barak Obama's policy of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, Dreamers faced deportation and may do so again if Congress does not act or if another President rescinds the policy. Finally, the movies, especially Spare Parts, are an excellent way to motivate students to read all or selected portions of Joshua Davis' book Spare Parts: Four Undocumented Teenagers, One Ugly Robot, and the Battle for the American Dream."

49,Billy Budd,"This film is a brilliant adaptation of Herman Melville's novella about a young man who is impressed from a merchant ship to a Royal Navy frigate. The story is set in 1797, during a war between royalist Britain and revolutionary France. The American and French revolutions have cast aside old concepts of authority and recent mutinies in the Royal Navy threaten hopes for military victory as well as the lives of the officers aboard ship. Billy Budd is innocent, gentle, and friendly. He is pitted against the ship's Master at Arms, Claggart, who is evil, cruel and determined to destroy Billy. When Claggart falsely accuses Billy of planning a mutiny, Billy responds with a blow to Claggart's head that results in the death of the Master at Arms. Adhering to the Articles of War, a set of harsh rules designed to assure order aboard ship, the ship's captain has Billy tried, convicted and hanged for the crime. The trial offers insight into the conflict between justice and law, responsibility to duty verses adherence to a personal moral code, and the struggle between good and evil. Benefits of the Movie:     For classes in English Language Arts: The film is an excellent tool to access Herman Melville's novella. The book, numbering fewer than 100 pages, is dense and difficult for modern readers. Still, it is well worth the struggle necessary to navigate complicated sentences and to process obsolete and esoteric vocabulary. The themes are as important today as ever they were; the characters are clear and extant in modern society. For social studies classes: The movie provides an accurate and vivid account of the impressment of seamen by the Royal Navy, life on warships at the end of the 18th century, and tensions in British society caused by the revolutionary spirit of the age. Situations in which the law conflicts with justice and when the obligations of duty conflict with a citizen's personal moral code are important issues for civics classes. Media literacy: Since ""Billy Budd"" is filmed in black and white, students can become better critics of film by learning to appreciate the use of contrasting shades of light, out of which comes much of the film's artistic merit.

The death throes of Gertrude, the Queen, may be disturbing to sensitive children. There is sexual tension between Hamlet and Gertrude, his mother. The director intended this and it is part of the interpretation of the play. Hamlet and Gertrude's conduct is only slightly inappropriate in some scenes, involving tender embraces and kissing. However, in the bedroom scene Hamlet loses his temper and taunts Gertrude about her sexual relationship with Claudius. He lies on top of her and humps to mock them. There is some minor violence between them. They kiss on the mouth. There is some carousing but it is not a major part of the movie.

It is appropriate to see the film prior to reading the play or while it is being read, as long as watching the movie does not serve as a substitute for reading. Before watching the movie, set the scene for your child and tell him or her about the law of unintended consequences (whether or not what you do has the effect you intend, it will have consequences that you don't expect and therefore don't intend).

This film describes the efforts of a disgruntled tobacco company executive and of a producer at CBS news to bring these activities to the attention of the public. The movie also describes the interference with the exposé by CBS management and how the producer had to go around management to break the story.

52,Bizet's Dream,"Michelle, a twelve-year-old girl living with her mother in Paris, is taking piano lessons from Georges Bizet. He is preoccupied with the effort to compose the opera Carmen. Events in Michelle's life and in Bizet's have parallels in the plot of the great opera. The girl's father is a French soldier stationed in Seville. She and her mother have not seen him in a long time. Don Jose, the primary male character in the opera, is also a French soldier stationed in Seville. He falls in love with Carmen, an attractive gypsy girl, and abandons his fiancé. Michelle becomes afraid that her father has run away with someone like Carmen and will never come home.

It is very accessible to ages 12 and up.",nan,"SUBSTANTIAL. To understand and correct for the problem with this film one must know something about the plot. The film introduces an ambitious English politician, Sir Robert Chiltern. When he was a young assistant to a member of the British Cabinet, Chiltern had given a foreign investor advance notice of a government decision. This information permitted the investor to make a large amount of money. Chiltern's fee for the information had made the young man moderately wealthy. When the story opens, Chiltern is a rising member of Parliament with an impeccable reputation. The foreign investor has died and no one, or so Chiltern thinks, knows how he obtained his wealth. This includes his morally upright and self-righteous wife, to whom he is devoted. However, the foreign investor, while on his deathbed, had given evidence incriminating Chiltern to a lady friend. The woman, Mrs. Cheveley, has made a large investment in a proposal to build a canal in Argentina. The plan is really a stock swindle and she knows it. If the British government backs the plan the stock will rise in value. Mrs. Cheveley will be able to sell out before the scheme collapses and make a large profit. Chiltern, now an Undersecretary in the British Cabinet, has been assigned to investigate the canal project. Mrs. Cheveley contacts him. She offers to give him the incriminating evidence and a substantial amount of money if he makes a false report supporting the scheme. If Chiltern does not comply, Mrs. Cheveley will publish the evidence, disgrace him, and end his political career. When Chiltern courageously condemns the canal swindle in Parliament, an action that he believes will lead to his own exposure and disgrace, an ingenious twist of the plot permits him to retain his money, his good name, and his career. However, the Chiltern character makes no attempt to atone for his past corrupt actions nor does he disgorge his ill-gotten gains. Instead, the film celebrates the fact that he will be permitted to escape censure because he has shown that he now has moral character and will not act corruptly again. If ""An Ideal Husband"" merely entertained us with the foibles of English ""society"" (see e.g. The Importance of Being Earnest) the ethical issues would be trivial. However, the film has impressive strengths. The characters seem to break out of the artificiality of the usual comedy of manners. They show us that blackmail should be resisted, politicians should be courageous, spouses should be forgiving, and friends should stand by each other. But at the end of the film. the comedy of manners reasserts itself and Sir Robert escapes from disgrace, without even a thought about the moral implications of his position. The strengths of the earlier parts of the film and empathy for the characters may mislead a viewer into thinking that this is a morally acceptable result.",nan

186,High Noon - Snippet Lesson Plan on the Expository Phase ELA: Expository Phase,"Released in 1953, ""High Noon"" is one of America's most respected Western films. It illuminates the struggle of a man who resists the forces of lawlessness despite the fact that no one else will stand with him. The first 15 minutes are the expository phase of the film, containing a clear presentation of setting, characters and a complication that will keep the audience interested. Background:     Will Kane, the protagonist, is ending a successful career as a marshal in what once was a crime-ridden frontier town. After years of hard work, Kane secured the conviction of Frank Miller, the leader of the gang that had terrorized the town. Miller is now in state prison and the town is a safe place in which to live. As the movie opens, Kane is marrying a beautiful Quaker woman who has prevailed on him to move to another town and become a shopkeeper. The conflict comes into focus at the end of the wedding ceremony, when it is learned that Miller has been released from prison and is coming back for revenge. He is scheduled to arrive on the noon train. His gang has reassembled and is waiting. Kane is unwilling to leave the town undefended until a new marshal, scheduled to arrive the next day, is sworn in. As the time for Miller's arrival approaches, every person in town, including long time friends, town officials, Kane's deputy marshal, and even his new wife, find some reason to decline the marshal's request that they stand with him in an effort to stop the outlaws. Shown in its entirety, ""High Noon"" provides an example of the use of foils, symbol and motif. It is an excellent basis for teaching the myths of the Western genre, some of which are still important in the cultures of the U.S., Canada, and Australia. The film has been called an allegory criticizing to the failure of political and business leaders, and even common people, to resist the excesses of the McCarthyites and the House Un-American Activities Committee during the Red Scare of the late 1940s and early 1950s. Made during the height of the Red Scare, ""High Noon"" is one of the few American movies in which the filmmakers had to disguise the political implications of their movie in order to get it made. As such, the film itself is an artifact of history. ""High Noon"" also contains a well crafted expository phase, which provides the opportunity for this Snippet Lesson Plan. Because of the many teaching opportunities provided by this movie for both English and history classes, TWM recommends making this lesson part of a larger unit based on the entire film.

187,Ice Princess,"This is a girls' sports formula movie that exceeds the expectations of its genre. The characters grow and change in ways that ring true. Casey is an ugly duckling high school physics geek whose mother has groomed her for Harvard. To become a graceful swan on ice, Casey must make her mother understand that Harvard is her mother's dream, not Casey's. She must also overcome her mother's disdain for women who pursue a sport. When Casey finally makes it to the ice, not only must she beat the competition, she must survive the stratagems of the skating rink owner (Tina). This woman will stop at nothing to ensure that her own child (Gen) makes it to the regional finals. Gen, it turns out, is tired of training most of the day, trying to live Tina's dream of glory on ice. A subplot details Gen's efforts to live a normal life in which she can see her boyfriend and go to parties. She even wants time to study so that she doesn't look like an idiot in math class. A second subplot involves the romance between Tina's son and Casey.",pics/ice-princess-DVDcover.jpg,,9,"""Ice Princess"" shows mothers trying to live their lives through their daughters and daughters strong enough to choose their own paths. The girls manage to remain loving despite their mothers' mistakes. The story demonstrates that family and personal conflicts can be resolved with caring. ""Ice Princess"" shows women excelling in sports and gives children a peek at the tough world of competitive ice skating. In conjunction with Bend It Like Beckham the movie provides an excellent opportunity to discuss the way to approach making an ethical decision.",nan,"MODERATE. In this movie, Casey and Gen are placed in difficult positions by their mothers' insistence that their daughters live out the mothers' dreams. The result is that the children lie for a time while they work out how to resolve their situations. Casey, the heroine, doesn't want to hurt her mother's feelings by insisting on skating. So, she lies and trains behind her mother's back. On a rigorous analysis, this is not a sufficient reason to lie to a parent because if Casey had been willing to insist on skating, her mother would not have forbidden her to do it. But much of the fault goes to Casey's mother who didn't listen to her daughter and didn't support her daughter's dream of figure skating. Casey's lie allowed her time to decide what she was going to do. Eventually, she told her mother and their relationship began to right itself. 

Gen lies to her mother about going to a party to see her boyfriend. This was because her mother insisted on a rigorous training schedule so that Gen could be the champion skater. But this was her mother's dream and not Gen's. Soon after the party, Gen confronted her mother and demanded a normal teenage life. One of the benefits of this change in their relationship was that Gen could go to parties without lying about it. Again, a formal ethical analysis would not condone Gen's lie, but both of these characters are basically good kids and the lies were a temporary solution while they worked out how to deal with the uncomfortable positions their mothers had placed them in. 

This movie has been criticized for spreading stereotypes, particularly the stereotype that a girl must be beautiful and graceful and not concerned with science or professional accomplishments. While ice skating is difficult and requires work and discipline, it is still a ""girl"" thing to do. 

These problem can be turned into strengths through frank discussions or they can simply be ignored without much ill effect if parents and teachers stress the positive aspects of the film.",nan
376,The Turning Point,"A detailed description of the plot of the film is necessary for parents and teachers to evaluate its suitability as a teaching tool. As the film begins, we learn that seventeen years earlier, Deedee (Shirley MacLaine), was a rising star with a major New York City dance company. When she became pregnant by one of the male dancers, they married, moved to Oklahoma, started a dance school, and had three children. The marriage is a happy one. Deedee's friend and rival, Emma (Anne Bancroft) stayed in New York and became the prima ballerina of the company. The action of the movie begins when the dance company, with Emma still its reigning ballerina, visits the town in which Deedee and her family live. Deedee has a party for the company, seeing Emma again for the first time in years. Deedee's sixteen year old daughter, Emilia, is allowed to take dance classes with the company. She dances so well that she is offered admission to the company ballet school. Deedee's son, about age 12, is having trouble choosing between ballet and baseball. At her husband's suggestion, Deedee takes Emilia and the boy to New York City to spend a summer taking intensive dance classes. They stay with Alexandra Danilova, the great prima ballerina, essentially playing herself. Now elderly, she coaches ballerinas and takes in boarders to make ends meet. In the company ballet school Emilia shines and she is given a principal role in a summer performance. Emilia, Deedee and Emma each have a major crisis during the course of the summer. Deedee is doubting her decision to abandon her career as a ballerina and concentrate on her family. Treated as just another parent at the company ballet school, she feels very much on the outside. She meets and has an affair with an old flame. Emilia meets Yuri, a famous dancer from Russia. (Yuri is Mikhail Baryshnikov playing himself; we are shown scenes of the company, including Baryshnikov, in class.) Yuri soon romances Emilia. They have a short affair which ends when Emilia sees Yuri and another ballerina kissing in a dressing room. Emilia also discovers that her mother is staying out all night. (How could she miss it? Mother and daughter sleep in the same room at Danilova's.) Emilia, naturally, is upset by her mother's infidelity as well as Yuri's shallowness. Emma is in crisis because younger dancers are being selected for the ballets that in the past had been her domain. Her lover, who in years past had offered to divorce his wife and marry her, gets cold feet when she hints that she might finally be receptive to a proposal. All the frustration and the years of pent-up jealousy between Deedee and Emma culminate in a comic fight in cocktail dresses outside of Lincoln Center. Deedee's husband comes to town and she realizes how lucky she is to have him. Emma begins to focus on being a mentor to Emilia. Everyone lives happily enough ever after, knowing that if you are going to give your life to artistry, there will be great sacrifices.",pics/turning-point-VHScover.jpg,,14,"This film shows fabulous dancing, the unremitting hard work demanded of a dancer, some of the inner workings of a major ballet company, the internal rivalries in a dance company, and the changing of the guard imposed by the aging of a prima ballerina. After this film was released, there was a flood of thousands of boys into dance schools across the nation. The movie explores the benefits and costs of a life led in pursuit of art and fame as opposed to a life concentrating on family and interpersonal relationships. In today's world, some ballerinas have families while they perform; but it is still difficult. The film shows that parents aren't perfect and sometimes need forgiveness from their children. The movie also explores issues of sexual fidelity and attraction. Deedee's husband is not a major figure in the film but he is consistently supportive and nurturing to all members of his family. There is a tastefully and beautifully choreographed scene of Emilia's first lovemaking with Yuri. It is soft edged and not graphic.",nan,"SERIOUS, BUT THEY CAN BE TURNED INTO BENEFITS. The plot of this film involves marital infidelity and sexual promiscuity. We showed this film to one of our sons when he was 11 years of age because of his strong interest in ballet. Before it started, his father took him aside and told him that there were problems with the way in which Deedee, Yuri and Emilia acted with regard to romance and sex. He talked a little about what we felt was appropriate. As shown from the description above, there are several other problems with the film. Deedee is going through a stage in which she is absorbed in finally reconciling her decision, some seventeen years earlier, to give up dance and raise a family. Her self-absorption causes her to miss an important opportunity to counsel Emilia about her relationship with Yuri. In addition, Deedee has an affair and does not conceal it from her daughter. Emilia is level headed and strong and she eventually forgives her mother. This situation rings true and can be turned into an important lesson for children that parents are not always perfect. (Parents beware, if you discuss this issue, some children will ask whether you've ever had an affair. Have your answer ready in advance.) Deedee's affair was certainly not appropriate behavior. It was primarily motivated by the emotions aroused by her return to NYC and rethinking her decision to have children and get married. The affair is not particularly important to her and ends by simply stopping, as many affairs do, when the underlying problem is solved. Moreover, Deedee's husband comes to New York and she realizes that he is the one that she really loves. Emilia, after she learns that she is just another one of Yuri's easy conquests, gets drunk and appears for a performance barely able to stand. This is a function, as much as anything else, of her discovery of her mother's affair and the fact that she had no one to talk with about her problems. After this one misstep, and when she can finally talk to Emma about the situation with Yuri, Emilia moves on, forgives her mother and can dance with Yuri with equanimity. In this she shows real strength of character. Parenting Points:     Before watching the movie tell your child that you have problems with the way in which Deedee, Yuri and Emilia acted with regard to romance and sex. After the movie talk a little about how what they did was not appropriate. With some children, a good way to start is to ask them what they thought about how these characters behaved.

195,Iron Jawed Angels,"Frustrated by the failure of the United States to adopt a constitutional amendment giving women the vote, militant suffragists led by Alice Paul mount an aggressive campaign demanding suffrage. They used parades and demonstrations with striking visual messages, campaigned against the Democratic party, which would not endorse the Amendment, and engaged in sustained picketing of the White House. The demonstrations were entirely peaceful and the banners often used the words of Woodrow Wilson, who was president at the time, to argue the justice of their cause. After the U.S. entered the First World War in 1917, many people expected all citizens to join together to support the war effort. The militant suffragists refused, noting that they had not been permitted to participate in making the decision on whether or not to go to war. They also pointed to the hypocrisy of a nation that was fighting a war to ""make the world safe for democracy"" but which refused to allow the vast majority of its female citizens to vote. The response was violent. Angry crowds assaulted the protesters and the police did little or nothing to protect them. Instead, the suffragists were arrested on false charges of blocking the sidewalk, convicted without due process of law, and sent to jail. In jail, they were confined in poor conditions and given rancid, wormy food. Their claim to be treated as political prisoners was rejected. Other inmates were incited by the guards to attack them. When some of the women protested their mistreatment, they were placed in solitary confinement. When the women went on hunger strikes in response, they were brutally force-fed. The government tried to have their leader, Alice Paul, declared insane so that she could be committed indefinitely, but its chief psychiatrist, after interviews with Miss Paul, decided that she was of sound mind. Word of the women's mistreatment got out and was publicized by the militants and their supporters. The public outcry was immense. The suffragists were applying all of the principles of nonviolent mass action: meeting violence with peacefulness; generating massive publicity; applying political or economic pressure; and making arguments that worked on the conscience of the general public and of their adversaries. The militants' campaign kept the suffrage issue in the forefront of the national consciousness and was a factor in leading President Wilson to change his position and work actively for passage of the 19th Amendment.",pics/iron-jawed-angels-dvd-cover.jpg,,11,"This movie can be used to vividly impress upon students the following important historical lessons not generally taught in textbooks:

(1) when the militant wing of the suffrage movement, led by Alice Paul, used nonviolent protests to demand the vote, they were assaulted by crowds of men and denied police protection;

(2) the government tried to suppress the militants' nonviolent protests with false arrests, unfair trials, imprisonment in harsh conditions, and what can best be described as torture;

(3) the militant suffragists withstood the violence, imprisonment, and torture, continuing their protests and refusing to back down, while strictly adhering to nonviolence;

(4) the arguments of the militant suffragists and the public's outrage at the way they were treated, as well as respect for the strength of the suffragists' commitment, were factors in the passage of the 19th Amendment, although the efforts of the National American Women's Suffrage Association (NAWSA) and its leader, Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, were probably more important long term factors in passing the amendment; and 

(5) Alice Paul and the NWP independently developed tactics of nonviolent protest which were strikingly similar to the methods of promoting political and social change being developed at about the same time by Mahatma Gandhi.

The film will inspire students to study the movement for women's equality, one of the five great advances in human rights in the U.S. since the beginning of the 20th century. The others were the grant of equal treatment for black Americans and other minorities, the procedural protections given to persons accused of crimes (achieved primarily through court decisions), granting access and other rights to the disabled (achieved through legislation) and the grant of equal rights to homosexuals, including the right to raise children and to marry. All these advances are works in process.",nan,"MODERATE. There are a number of historical errors and distortions in the film. See Helpful Background Section. These problems can be briefly corrected and turned into strengths by discussing them. For a more extensive correction students can be given TWM's student handout, Alice Paul and the Struggle for the 19th Amendment: What Really Happened. Parenting Points:     All that is necessary is to show the film and to point out that the scenes relating to the militant's efforts and their arrest and imprisonment are reasonably accurate. Correct the historical errors by stating that while Alice Paul and her militants played an important role in getting the vote for women, Mrs. Catt and her organization probably deserves more of the credit. Certainly, they deserve more credit than they were given in the movie. It was NAWSA, under Mrs. Catt's leadership, which did the basic political work of creating suffrage organizations in most states, getting states to adopt women's suffrage and working with the President. In addition, not shown in the movie is the fact that once President Wilson was converted to the suffragist side, he worked actively to get the 19th Amendment passed in Congress and ratified by the states. His political intervention was crucial in the success of the campaign to pass the amendment. Children are often interested in specific scenes that are accurate portrayals of real events.

196,It's a Wonderful Life,"Set in upstate New York during the first half of the 20th century, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" tells the story of a young man who wanted to travel, have adventures, go to college, and be an architect in a big city. But George Bailey's responsibilities to his family and to his community kept him from leaving the small town where he grew up. He held down a responsible job, raised a family, treated people decently, and helped out whenever he could. One tumultuous Christmas Eve, Bailey is shown how much he has meant to those around him and that happiness can be found in family, friends and fulfilling responsibility, right in your own home town. This charming Hollywood classic is almost as fresh today as when it was released in 1946. Many think it's a better Christmas story than A Christmas Carol. Many say it's one of the greatest films ever made. If they're wrong, they're not off by much. The movie is suitable for viewing at any time of the year.",pics/its-a-wonderful-life-DVDcover.jpg,,10,"""It's a Wonderful Life"" teaches that everyone can make a difference by living a responsible, caring life. In addition, it presents the counterargument to the contention that young people should follow their own star, leave the community in which they grew up, and go out into the world. In the view of this film, a wonderful life depends upon family, friends and having an honest job that contributes to the community. Finding the right balance between self-fulfillment and dedication to others is a major developmental task, indeed, it is a challenge for all age groups. This movie contains valuable lessons for the 21st century, especially in these days of rampant corporate and business greed. Bailey, as head of the town's savings and loan association, keeps his own salary at a reasonable level. He makes sure that the S & L is operated for the benefit of its members and serves the interests of the community. He has a lifelong competition with the town's richest businessman who, despite his vast wealth, will do anything to make another buck. Possible Problems:    Minor. ""It's a Wonderful Life"" posits a simplistic religious view of angels in heaven who look after individuals on earth and answer their prayers. This is not intended to be taken seriously. Perhaps a greater problem with the movie is that the villain, Mr. Potter, gets away with his greed and a serious crime, although he is denied any triumph over George Bailey. Harry Bailey (George's younger brother) playfully chases the black maid into the kitchen in a scene that would not be permitted today. George Bailey approves a loan from the S & L to a friend (hard not to do in such a small town). In theory and hopefully in practice, this transaction would not be accepted in today's business environment. Parenting Points:     Ask and help your child to discuss the issues raised in the Quick Discussion Questions.

This film has the violence that films about war require, not graphic or especially gory. There are many racial epithets used against the heroes of the film. There is one suicide, shown as a terrible waste .","Rationale for Using the Movie: The Tuskegee Airmen shows another step on the road to full equality for African-Americans in the U.S. military. During the Civil War, black foot soldiers demonstrated that blacks could fight under the conditions of modern warfare; they made a substantial contribution to the Union war effort. In 1948 President Truman ordered the complete integration of the armed forces. The film will enable students to see the significance of President George Bush's 1989 selection of General Colin Powell as the first African-American Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the highest military post in the United States."
67,Captains Courageous,"Harvey, a spoiled rich kid about 10 years old, is expelled from his private boarding school. Taken on an ocean voyage by his father, Harvey falls overboard while the ship is sailing off the Grand Banks. He is miraculously rescued by a Gloucester fishing boat on a three-month trip. Harvey's demands that he be immediately taken to land are ignored. Given a choice between not eating and pitching in to help, he finds a whole new world of friendship and maturity. Benefits of the Movie: ""Captains Courageous"" paints a vivid portrait of a spoiled brat and how, through adversity and tragedy, he matures. It will acquaint children with the demanding life of a fisherman during the first half of the 20th century. Possible Problems: MINOR. Harvey, the rich kid, is slapped once in the face by the Captain to discipline him. Some alcohol abuse is shown. Manuel's fervent Catholicism is treated in a reverent fashion.

He also pioneered coordinated backfield movements, called ""the shift,"" which is used to maximize the chance for a large gain on a running play. This film will acquaint children with this innovative man. It will provide an opportunity to discuss the view that college sports are a game subordinate to the important work of education: e.g., Knute Rockne never intervened with a teacher to get a higher grade for one of his players; if a player's grades were not good enough, he was off the team. The film contains newsreel footage of Notre Dame football games.",nan,"MINOR. This is an old black and white film, acted in a style not current today. (Children should be accustomed to black and white films before they see this movie.) Rockne abandons a promising career as a research chemist and teacher to become a football coach. It is made clear that for all his talent in chemistry, coaching was where his heart and genius really lay. The Catholic hierarchy of Notre Dame University is shown with unquestioning worshipful reverence. The recent sex abuse scandals in the Catholic Church have shown the danger of this attitude. Children watching this film should be warned that even a respected occupation, such as the priesthood, draws some people who abuse their position.",nan
215,The Lion King,"""The Lion King"" tells the story of Simba, his birth, the murder of his father by his Uncle Scar, Simba's exile, and his return. The film is a Disney animation with excellent music.",pics/lion-king-DVDcover.jpg,BL,8,"""The Lion King"" deals with the death of a parent, betrayal, guilt, running away, denial, ambition, coming of age, redemption, and friendship. See Social-Emotional Learning and Ethical Emphasis Discussion Questions. The film can serve as an introduction to Africa, food chains, the interdependence of the hunter and the hunted, lions, hyenas, meerkats, and warthogs. The movie contains an excellent example of an adult manipulating a child that can be used to help children identify, defend against, and report this type of conduct. (See An Example of Manipulative Conduct by an Adult below). Finally, this movie can introduce children to the fact that Africa has a history of rulers and conquests some of which has come down to us in oral traditions. See Sundiata in the Helpful Background section.",nan,"MODERATE. This animated feature contains disturbing violence. We therefore do not recommend it for children below the age of eight. Parents or teachers of sensitive eight year olds should probably wait a year or two before they show the film. The violence includes: blood thirsty hyenas chasing Simba; a wildebeest stampede from which Simba is saved in the nick of time by Mufasa, his father; the murder of Mufasa by Scar, Mufasa's brother (Scar throws Mufasa off a cliff into the herd of stampeding wildebeests); and a violent fight at the end of the movie between Simba and Scar. 

Simba grieves touchingly for his father. This could upset sensitive children especially if there has been a recent death in the family. (This could also be a strength of the film, allowing a child who has suffered a loss that he or she has not dealt with to find an outlet for his or her grief.) 

For some, the message of the film may be overpowered by the infectious musical numbers in the ""hakuna matata"" scenes (""you won't get hurt if you don't care about anything therefore to avoid being hurt, don't care about anything"") and the alluring personalities of Timon (the meerkat character) and Pumbaa (the warthog character). After the movie is over, adults should point out that by the end of the film, not only Simba but also Timon and Pumbaa, reject ""hakuna matata"" in favor of involvement. When Simba returns to face Scar and the hyenas, Timon and Pumbaa help him out.",nan
211,Les Misérables,"These films tell parts of Victor Hugo's epic novel of poverty, crime, redemption, romantic love and revolution in France in the early 19th century. The 1978 film develops the characters of Jean Valjean and Javert in an excellent fashion. The 1998 film version is beautiful and well made with some powerful performances. This version tracks the novel in most respects but has unnecessary moderately graphic violence and offensive scenes showing nudity and the life of a prostitute. In addition, the characters of Valjean and Javert are not developed as clearly as in the 1978 made for TV version. For a discussion of the 1995 film version, see Notes on Movies For Which a Learning Guide has not been Prepared. Benefits of the Movie:     These films will acquaint children with this epic story and with its characters who have become archetypes: Jean Valjean, a man condemned by poverty and classification as a convicted felon but redeemed by the kindness of one man and his own will; Cosette, the child victim of poverty; Bishop Myriel, the social activist who believes in the essential goodness of man; and Javert, the petty, regulation bound, and shortsighted bureaucrat who relentlessly and unreasonably pursues a good man for a violation that should have been forgotten long ago.

They will retain striking visual images of Abraham Lincoln, Thaddeus Stevens, and the passage of the resolution sending the 13th Amendment to the States for ratification — all within the context of the broad effort to end slavery in the U.S. They will understand why the 13th Amendment was necessary to invalidate protections for slavery written into the Constitution by the Founding Fathers. Students will be motivated to do their best on research and writing assignments.",nan,Rationale: The decision to emancipate the slaves and to reject the bargain between North and South that gave Constitutional protection to slavery is one of the most important developments in U.S. history. President Abraham Lincoln is among the three greatest Presidents in U.S. history. The film Lincoln provides visual and emotional depth as well as a dramatic high point to the unit. This lesson plan allows teachers to use the film Lincoln without introducing errors of historical perspective.

They will become familiar with the way that volcanoes are classified and four of the important phenomena that happen before and during eruptions: heating of underground and surface water, lava flows, ash clouds, and volcanic bombs. Students will be introduced to volcanic events at: Paricutin, Mexico; Pinatube in the Philippines; and Eyjafjallajökull in Iceland.",nan,The unlikely event of a volcano erupting in the middle of Los Angeles and the film's mix of volcanic features will provide interest and dramatic effect to the lesson. The events of the movie are loosely based on real incidents in which a volcano suddenly surged to life in an unexpected location and when advancing lava was cooled and stopped with water. Comparison of the real events with the film will reinforce the differences between fact and fiction in movies while providing interest and context for the lesson.
57,Born Free,"This is the true story of the domestication and successful reintroduction into the wild of the lion named Elsa. The film is based on the book by Joy Adamson.

""Michael Collins"" when compared to Gandhi can lead to fascinating discussions about the use and abuse of violence by oppressed peoples. This film also demonstrates how dramatic devices distort historical accuracy. A discussion of this topic will build critical viewing skills and is necessary to correct a misimpression left by the film. Eamon De Valera serves the dramatic structure of the story as the villain. The truth is not nearly so clear and the characterization is inaccurate. There is no evidence that De Valera plotted to have Collins killed. The film's rejection of De Valera's position, that nothing short of full independence would justify peace, is never explained or justified. Nor is it shown that years later De Valera came round and served with distinction as President of the Irish Free State before full independence was attained. The need for a villain in the film overpowered historical accuracy and the film is misleading in its characterization of De Valera.",nan,"SERIOUS.

Sometime, before having students read a novel or a short story, or watch a film or a play, introduce the lesson with a provocative concept: there are subtexts of meaning below the surface of almost every human interaction. 

Begin by asking what might have occurred in the mind of an individual that led to the invention of the chair? What thought drove this prehistoric person to pound together a few chunks of wood so that someone might sit? 

The kids will drift through various suggestions: desire for comfort, avoidance of dirt or bugs, an effort to keep dry in wet weather. To spark deeper thought, describe the scene of the school parking lot and the after-school rush to the cars in which we hear the cry ""shotgun"" ring out from kids who don't drive. They're trying to get the second most prestigious seat in the car.

Then talk about status in a family. Does anyone have a family in which one member always sits at the head of the table or in the best armchair in front of the television? When appropriate, mention the difference between the chair occupied by a judge who presides over a trial and the chair in which the defendant sits.

It can serve as a motivator in the study of the scientific method, chemistry, biology, neurology, and genetics. The film is an excellent introduction to the medical research establishment and the ethics of clinical trials. Merely watching this movie is a hard-hitting life experience. It teaches courage, persistence and that sometimes motivated people can achieve what had seemed impossible. It also shows that the disabled are real people with feelings and intelligence. The film explores some of the problems in getting society to take note of and to address extremely rare diseases. The movie and this Learning Guide provide several opportunities to teach critical viewing skills. The movie contains a key factual error that provides an excellent opportunity to teach the scientific method. At the time the movie was released, scientific studies had demonstrated that Lorenzo's Oil did not work for other ALD patients who, like Lorenzo, had already developed symptoms of the disease. Lorenzo's reaction to the Oil was an anomaly. (We are not aware of any explanation for why the Oil worked with Lorenzo.) The worries of the scientists and ALD Foundation leaders about holding out false hope to families (concerns that were ridiculed in the movie) turned out to be entirely justified. Then, in a twist of fate, scientific studies completed ten years after the film was made found Lorenzo's Oil to be effective in preventing ALD in a different group of people, boys with the ALD genetic defect who did not yet have neurological symptoms. Ironically, these studies were performed by Dr. Hugo Moser. In the movie, the character modeled on Dr. Moser, Dr. Nikolais, is portrayed as the epitome of the unresponsive medical establishment. TWM's Lesson Plan -- The Development of Lorenzo's Oil, Strange Twists of Fate, and the Scientific Method uses these circumstances as the basis for an exercise in applying the scientific method and developing hypotheses in a real world situation. ""Lorenzo's Oil"" is most helpful if students are given a description of certain scientific and biological concepts before they see the film. These are provided in the Introductory Concepts Handout. TWM's scientific methods lesson plan provides a review of the process by which Lorenzo's Oil was discovered. If you can project images from the Internet onto a screen, the animation from the Myelin Project and the Diagrams of Four Fatty Acids will be very helpful. A Comprehension Test and Medical Ethics Test are also provided with this Learning Guide. Omouri Hassane and Lorenzo Odone",nan,"SERIOUS. There are heartrending scenes showing Lorenzo's increasing disability and his coughing fits in which, unable to swallow, he chokes on his own saliva. The film may upset sensitive children. It may be a good idea to tell children as they watch this movie that it is a mostly true story, that Lorenzo, in the end, survives, although he is still seriously disabled, and that the Odones' efforts to save their son have allowed other children affected by the disease to live happy and productive lives. Some viewers may be distracted by Nick Nolte's heavily accented English. However, Nolte simply provides a fair rendition of how the real Augusto Odone sounds when he speaks English.

It ends with the following statement written by Tolstoy: The most difficult thing -- but an essential one -- is to love Life, to love it even while one suffers, because Life is all. Life is God, and to love Life is to love God.",nan,"MINOR. This story is told from the Russian point of view. At the beginning of the film, Napoleon is referred to as the scourge of Europe. It is true that Napoleon's ambition led to war, death and destruction throughout most of Europe. However, Napoleon imposed, wherever he conquered, the benefits of the Napoleonic Code, improved educational opportunities, fair administration, etc. The Russian monarchy was reactionary and oppressive. It cared little for its people. The people of Russia resisted Napoleon because he was a foreign invader, not because they loved the Tsar. Parenting Points:     See Helpful Background section. Set a historical background for the film. Tell your child that in modern times there have been two countries that had conquered most of Europe and then tried to invade Russia. The first was France under Napoleon and the second was Germany under Hitler during WWII. On both occasions the Russians repulsed the invaders. There were several reasons. They include: (1) Russia is very big and the winters are incredibly cold; colder than anything experienced in Germany or France. (2) The Russians in both instances followed a scorched earth policy: cities and villages were burned; factories were moved or destroyed; and stocks of food and grain were moved or burned. There was not enough food to sustain the invading troops. When Napoleon reached Moscow, the capital of Russia, he found that the Russians had burned the city to the ground.

She argues that it's not fair to kill the little pig just because he can't compete with his larger brothers and sisters. A spider named Charlotte creates a sensation by describing Wilbur with words spun into her web. Her goal is to make Wilbur so famous that his owners will not make him into a Christmas ham. Wilbur survives, Fern grows and gets interested in a boy, but Charlotte, having lived the allotted time for a spider, spins her egg sac, languishes, and dies. Wilbur takes care of the egg sac for his friend and tells her children all about their mother.",pics/charlottes-web-DVD-cover.jpg,BL,5,"The lessons of this story include: the possibilities of affection between individuals of different species; acceptance of individuals who are different (that we must look behind appearance to see the true worth of an individual); the value of friendship; and acceptance of the natural rhythms of life.

124,Fat Man and Little Boy,"This film is an account of the Manhattan Project, the super-secret crash program by the United States to make the first atomic bomb. It centers on the relationship between General Leslie Groves, the military man in charge of the entire project, and its scientific director, Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer led the scientific and engineering team that solved the physics and technical problems involved in creating and delivering the bomb. The movie also explains the development of ""Little Boy,"" the uranium bomb detonated over Hiroshima by a gun-type device, and ""Fat Man,"" the plutonium bomb detonated through implosion at Nagasaki.",pics/fat-man-little-boy-DVDcover.jpg,PH,13,"Through the dialogue we hear much of the debate concerning the use of atomic weapons and whether the U.S. should have dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The film is an excellent way to introduce or complete a discussion of this topic in conjunction with TeachWithMovies' Lesson Plan on Mass Casualties and Making Decisions About War which includes an in-depth analysis of the decision to end WWII with atomic bomb attacks on Japan. This movie shows how the United States assembled the manpower and created the organization to use forces inside the atom as a weapon. It shows men working together as a team, resolving their differences, and achieving success through the use of intelligence, goodwill towards each other, and commitment to a common goal. The Manhattan Project is another demonstration that one of the reasons the Allies won the Second World War was the ability to successfully manage complex organizations. Because ""Fat Man and Little Boy"" focuses on the development of both the implosion and explosion models for triggering a nuclear chain reaction, the movie can supplement lessons about fission, fusion, supercritical mass, chain reaction, and other aspects of subatomic physics. The film briefly introduces important scientists, such as Enrico Fermi, Leo Szilard, and Robert Wilson. The movie also explores the sometimes tense partnership between the military and the scientific community as they dealt with the extreme pressure of building a nuclear bomb on a tight schedule.",nan,"MODERATE. The most important consideration is an issue of focus. The Manhattan Project ushered in the age of atomic warfare and resulted in the deaths of several hundred thousand human beings. No study of the decision to make and use the atom bomb is complete without an understanding of the damage and injury at Hiroshima or Nagasaki. See Lesson Plan on Mass Casualties and Making Decisions About War which focuses on this event. One of the scientists dies, gruesomely, of radiation exposure. Oppenheimer is shown having an extramarital affair. There is a scene, not at all graphic, showing him in bed with the ""other"" woman. There are some historical inaccuracies.

234,Mass Casualties Lesson Plan,"Why study the summer of 1945? Historian William Manchester described it as ""a kind of historical hinge ... everything which had been, no longer was ... and everything that was to be, became."" The surprise atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were two of the most important events of that very important time. 

Another reason to study the atomic bombing of Japanese cities arises from the fact that no mass casualty caused by human beings, save one, has ever had anything close to a reasonable justification. That one exception is the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. While there are strong arguments that the bombing was not a legitimate way to bring a quick end to WWII, there are also strong arguments that it was. 

In addition, the atomic attacks were not perpetrated by savages, fanatic nationalists, communist dictators, or repressive fascist regimes. The atomic bombs were unleased by the United States, a highly evolved democratic society which embodies many of the highest aspirations of humankind. The intentional killing of so many non-combatants by such a country adds significance to the event. 

The skills taught by an in-depth analysis of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki will be especially useful for students in any country which possesses nuclear weapons or strong armies: the U.S., Russia, China, Great Britain, France, India, Pakistan, Israel, etc. Elections and the political process in these countries may determine important issues of war and peace.

We get a feeling for what it was like to fly in a B-17 during a mission. This movie will have the best effect if seen in conjunction with Dawn Patrol (about an air squadron during WWI) and Twelve O'Clock High (about the problems faced by the commander of a WWII bomber squadron assigned to daylight bombing).",nan,"MODERATE. There are several brief references to ""getting laid,"" condoms etc. There is quite a bit of death, a little gore and a lot of profanity.

Michael has become a codependent Enabler in Chief, while their children are suffering from their mother's inconsistent behavior. The movie is a gripping tale of love struggling against alcoholism and codependence.",pics/when-a-man-loves-a-woman-DVDcover.jpg,,13,"""When a Man Loves a Woman"" provides emotional insight into a committed relationship. It is an excellent description of alcoholism and its effects on a family. Michael has learned to protect Alice from the consequences of being drunk. He sees someone he loves in pain and does what he can to reduce that pain. Alice encourages this behavior because it allows her to live an intoxicated life without paying the price. Over the years, Michael's enabling behavior has become deeply embedded in the way he relates to Alice. He has become a codependent. Mid-way through the movie, Alice ""hits bottom"" and realizes she has a serious problem with alcohol. She enters a treatment center and returns home desperately trying to stay sober. Alice soon realizes that she no longer wants Michael to protect her from the consequences of her actions, as he had done when she was frequently intoxicated. Taking responsibility for her own actions is an important part of her recovery. Their marriage is put under tremendous strain as Alice insists that Michael change the way he relates to her. The last third of the movie shows how the couple struggles to adjust to Alice's new persona and the altered terms of their relationship. Throughout the movie we are given hints of the impact of Alice's drinking and the couple's marital difficulties on Alice's eight-year-old daughter, Jessica. All of this is done with emotional insight and cinematic skill. Another benefit of the film is Michael's steadfast commitment to the oldest daughter, Jessica. Alice gave birth to Jessica before she met Michael but he is fully committed to being the girl's father. His character shows that love for a child comes from raising the child, not from being a biological parent.",nan,"MODERATE. There is a limited amount of profanity in the movie. The couple talks about having sex rather than making love. This is just the way they talk. These two people deeply love each other. After Alice goes into recovery, she smokes all the time. This is a realistic touch because many alcoholics smoke heavily after they enter recovery. The couple is shown in a frustrating and ineffective therapy session in which there is no chemistry with the therapist. This could be interpreted by kids as an indictment of therapy. We suggest ignoring the first problem and turning the second and third into strengths with a brief discussion, see Lesson Plan on Alcohol Abuse, Alcoholism and Codependence. Parenting Points:     Watch the movie with your child and go through as many of the discussion questions as you can. If you can get your child to read the handouts on Alcohol -- and How it Affects Us and Codependence -- What Happens When a Family Member is an Alcoholic or a Drug Addict, do so. Review them yourself and you will be able to give your child some accurate information and tell some interesting stories. If anyone in your extended family has had to contend with alcoholism or drug addiction, TWM recommends that you tell them the stories of their relative's battle with substance abuse. TWM also recommends taking your children to an open Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meeting. Start at the age of 12 or 13 and visit again every one or two years. As kids get older they will get more out of each session. Some AA meetings are divided into two parts. Try to stay for the second part. That's when specially selected speakers talk about the difficulties they encountered while intoxicated and their new lives in sobriety. Tell kids that if they ever have trouble with alcohol, the twelve steps of AA provide a path to recovery.",nan

She lives in a time when the Huns are invading China from the North. Mulan's father is old and infirm. When the Emperor calls upon each family to contribute a soldier to the army, Mulan's father is determined to answer the Emperor's call.

246,Modern Times,"This is a lighthearted satire of urban industrial life in the first half of the 20th century. While working on an assembly line, the ""Little Tramp"" gets a tick that makes him move like a machine. He then becomes stuck on a conveyor belt and run through another machine. He is used as a test dummy for a feeding machine. The boss spies on him in the men's room through hidden cameras. He meets a waif and falls in love. He is mistakenly labeled a Communist and arrested. He encounters cocaine while in jail. He gets a job in a department store but loses it. He works as a waiter, only to lose that job. None of these setbacks crush his spirit. ""Modern Times"" is acknowledged to be the last of the great silent movies. Although it does have some sound, there is no spoken dialogue. Benefits of the Movie:     While quite funny, ""Modern Times"" contains famous and enduring images that make serious social comments. It is also an excellent introduction to silent films, to Charlie Chaplin, one of the greatest actor/directors of all time, and to his classic ""Little Tramp"" character. The movie will also introduce children to the assembly line, the poverty of the Great Depression, the labor unrest that occurred during the Great Depression, and the redbaiting that was used to suppress labor unions.

250,Much Ado About Nothing,"The 1993 Classic Version: This film is an excellent introduction to Shakespeare's comedies. The acting is so strong and the direction so clear that students can easily follow the complications that beset two sets of lovers.

Shakespeare Retold: The BBC has had the play rewritten for modern audiences. The setting is a local newsroom in Britain and the characters, from the news anchors to the security guards, are drawn from Shakespeare's play. The result is also delightful and stands on its own as an enjoyable experience for the viewer. It's especially entertaining for those who have seen the classic version or read the play.

The scenes are realistic, and the drug use is not shown in a positive light. There is virtually no interpersonal violence.

Bigger inadvertently smothers Mary, the daughter of the family that employs him and that is trying to help him. He then laboriously shoves the corpse into the family's furnace and burns it. These scenes are extremely disturbing. This is not cookie cutter violence but a realistically portrayed death of a person and the destruction of her corpse.

See TWM's Historical Fiction in Film Cross-Curricular Homework Project.",Possible Problems: Minor. Smoking and alcohol abuse are shown.,"Rationale for Using the Movie:
English Language Arts Classes: The film provides an excellent example of extended metaphor. It shows the interaction between extended metaphor and symbol. The movie also provides an example of the Hero's Journey, Joseph Campbell's Monomyth, in which the hero undertakes a quest of personal growth and development. 

Social Studies Classes: The movie will confirm basic lessons about the early part of WWII in Europe and Africa and will provide students with a visceral understanding of the movement of American sentiment away from isolationism and to engagement on the world stage. The film is an excellent example of historical fiction, even though it doesn't mention the most important historical events which it portrays."
266,The Nutcracker,"This Christmas sugarplum is probably the most popular ballet in the world. It begins with a Christmas Eve party in an eighteenth century Northern European home. The mysterious godfather Drosselmeyer appears, bringing mechanical dolls which perform impressive dances before they wind down and are put away. He then gives a nutcracker doll to his favorite, young Marie (Clara in the Baryshnikov/ABT version). Her naughty brother Franz takes it from her and breaks the Nutcracker. The young girl is crestfallen but godfather Drosselmeyer repairs it. After the party, she drifts off to sleep beside the Christmas tree, cradling her beloved new doll. In a fantastic dream, the tree grows to outlandish size as magic overtakes her world. Evil mice, led by their king, try to attack Marie/Clara. 

In the Balanchine/NYC Ballet production, following the classic story and using the classic dances, Drosselmeyer's young nephew, who had fascinated Marie at the party the evening before, becomes the Nutcracker and defeats the Mouse-King. He then sits with Marie as the Sugarplum Fairy presents dancers to them suggested, as is frequently the case in dreams, from events of the day before: Spanish/chocolate, Arabian/coffee, Chinese/tea; Russian or Candy cane, Waltzing flowers and Whirling mirlitons/marzipan. 

The Baryshnikov/ABT version departs from the classic story line during the dream sequence. The Nutcracker and the Mouse-King fight and both are killed; but the mice defeat the toy soldiers. Suddenly Drosselmeyer appears, revives the Nutcracker and turns him into a handsome prince. The Nutcracker/Prince spirits Clara away through a forest of snow sprites. They arrive in the kingdom of the Sugarplum Fairy where they are royally entertained by a suite of delectable divertissements (short dances) sparked by memories of the day before: Spanish/chocolate, Arabian/coffee etc. But it is, after all, a dream and Drosselmeyer appears to summon Clara back to reality as a young girl with dreams for the future. 

The Balanchine/NYC Ballet offering presents the ballet as a movie production using the classical dances and following the traditional story line. This film is the best to show to very young children (under 10). The cast includes a large number of child dancers with whom they can identify. Marie is very naturally acted and well danced by Jessica Lynn Cohen. Kevin Kline's narration provides a clear framework for understanding the action. The production is spirited and entertaining. Our only criticism is that Macaulay Culkin is shamelessly miscast as Dr. Drosselmeyer's nephew, a transparent effort to attract audiences by importing a movie star. He is not a dancer and, in this production, doesn't look like much of an actor.",pics/nutcracker-DVDcover.jpg,,5,"Filled with themes that will interest both boys and girls, this film is an excellent introduction to ballet. Older children who are interested in ballet will enjoy the technical virtuosity of the dancers. The ""Nutcracker"" can also serve as the basis for a discussion of the little girl's dream and an introduction to the role of wish fulfillment and remnant memories in the creation of dreams. ""The Nutcracker"" is frequently performed at Christmas by local and regional ballets. Many of these productions are excellent and offer close to professional quality. Better than watching the films is to take children to one of these performances where they can see children and adults from their own community perform on stage. Check your local newspaper for listings. If your children show interest in the stage production, you can watch one of these films with them and compare.",nan,None.

3,127 Hours,"Note to teachers: Students love adventure stories, especially tales about young people and most especially when the stories are true. Still, students are often reluctant to read what many times can be a long build-up to the action they crave. Aron Ralston's book is ruminative and informative in its effort to explain how he managed to survive. Most young readers will want to skim the details about his outdoor adventures, the hikes, the climbs, and the description of terrain that is mostly unfamiliar and desolate. They will want to go quickly to the moment when Ralston falls and thus skip the reflection, fear and inspiration that finally leads him to cut off his arm and free himself mere hours from certain death. In anticipation of such reluctant readers, this lesson plan uses valuable information that Ralston conveys in his book to inform a more thorough understanding of the film. Ralston's self-examination and the philosophical journey he experiences during his 127 hours of entrapment deepen the message conveyed in the movie and may provoke some students to read the book itself. If administrators or parents balk at screening the film at school, or if there is no available class time, take advantage of the fact that most kids will have seen the movie and that, for those who haven't, Ralston's story can be described in a few short sentences. Thus, the description of the chapters and the assignments in the Student Handout can be benefit to students who do not watch the film.",pics/127-hours-DVDcover.jpg,EN,14,nan,Objectives/Student Outcomes Using this Learning Guide:     Students will exercise their writing skills on a subject that interests them. They will consider and discuss the values that enabled Ralston to survive his ordeal.,Possible Problems: Any fear associated with confinement can be exacerbated by watching this film. The scene in which Aron frees himself by breaking bones and cutting through flesh is graphic and medically accurate. It may be disturbing to some students.,"Rationale for Using the Movie      By addressing ideas presented in the book before showing the movie, students will be led to examine how an individual can call upon his past in order to maintain composure in the face of doom. Each reference to one of Ralston's chapters described in the Student Handout introduces an idea that helps readers understand the young man who gathers the courage to cut off his arm and walk away from certain death. Suggested assignments are designed to encourage students to write freely in response to the information given and to empathize with the attributes of character that served Ralston so well. Then, as students watch the film, they will be able to see how ideas they have considered and written about are described visually."
274,Old Yeller,"In this Disney classic, a stray dog adopts the family of a former Confederate soldier living in frontier Texas. The time is just after the Civil War and everyone is very poor. Despite initial missteps, Yeller wins his way into everyone's heart and saves the lives of several family members. In the process, he is bitten by a rabid wolf. The film is based on the novel by Fred Gipson. Benefits of the Movie: This movie shows the marginal life of frontier homesteads in the West after the Civil War. The characters exhibit the courage required to overcome the difficulties of that environment. Possible Problems: MINOR: The youngest boy, Arliss, throws rocks at his older brother and acts recklessly, placing himself in danger, all without being punished. Ignoring his mother's orders, Arliss almost allows the then rabid Yeller out of the corn crib where the dog has been confined for observation. If Yeller were to bite Arliss, the child would probably die of rabies. The failure of this movie to deal with Arliss' misbehavior can be turned into an opportunity to tell children that rocks are dangerous weapons that can put out an eye or even kill another person. You can also explain to your child that reckless children like Arliss live simply by luck, and that their lack of foresight often gets them or someone else injured or killed. (Ask your child: What would have happened if the mother had been one minute later and Arliss had let Yeller, aggressive and rabid, out of the pen?) This movie is sad at the end and children may cry after seeing it. If you don't already have a dog at home, your children will probably beg you for one after they see this film. There are a number of fights between Yeller and various animals (a bear, hogs, a wolf). These may be frightening to extremely young and sensitive viewers. Parenting Points:     Before watching the film, briefly talk about rabies. See Helpful Background. Immediately after the movie, or at odd times over the next week (for example at the dinner table or in the car on the way to school) bring up some of the Discussion Questions, starting with the Quick Discussion Question in the sidebar.

He has discovered that he gains for himself the strength and power of his doppelgangers if he kills them. In this multiverse it is a crime not only to murder, but also to travel between universes. The movie is set just before he attempts to kill the last of the 124 alterative versions of himself. In the second clip we see Mr. Law being arrested and sentenced to life in a prison located in a penal universe after he has murdered the 123rd version of himself.

It will permit children to vicariously explore the limits and ultimate futility of racism, the deep emotional currents unleashed by a decision to marry, the difficulties of friendship among colonial administrators and their subjects, and the need to prevent injustice. It critiques imperialism as a system that limits and warps personal relationships between the oppressed and the oppressors. The novel is a classic of English literature. Some children who are 14 years or older will enjoy the book. These children should be encouraged to read it before they see the film. The film will then supplement the book with its vivid images of India during the British Raj. However, the book provides so much detail and nuance that it is good reading even after the film has been seen. Regardless of whether children are going to read the book or see the film, read them the two passages quoted in the first section of the Helpful Background Section. (See below.) These excerpts will demonstrate that there really were ""Turtons and Burtons"" who ran the British Empire and give a graphic example of how they thought. Possible Problems:    None.

Although in the novel by Ken Kesey, McMurphy manipulates the situation by organizing the outing and making a tidy profit for himself, in the film he simply absconds with a bus full of inmates, picks up his girlfriend and hijacks a fishing boat. The joyful energy spent catching the fish shows on the faces of the inmates; they have become happy, successful men rather than the troubled spirits they are at the hospital. Whether or not students read the book or see the entire movie, the snippet illustrates one of the film's ideas: society determines what is crazy and what is not crazy and this determination is created through observable behavior; in other words, crazy is as crazy does.",pics/cuckoos-nest-DVDcover.jpeg,,12,nan,Students will practice deriving theme from a scene in a novel that has been adapted to film.,nan,"The scene is a powerful presentation of a thematic concept.

Caught in a perfect storm of bad luck, he becomes homeless. However, he manages to take care of his son while pursuing a highly competitive, unpaid internship as a stockbroker. The film was ""inspired by"" events in the life of Christopher Gardner, who was once homeless. He is now a wealthy stockbroker, as well as a proud father. This movie is highly engaging. The story is well-written, the production values are high, and Will Smith's acting is simply magnificent.",pics/pursuit-of-happyness-DVDcover.jpg,,12,"""The Pursuit of Happyness"" shows a homeless African-American father taking responsibility for his child, while succeeding as a stockbroker. It also has excellent messages about the importance of keeping your cool in the face of incredible disappointment and provocation. Time after time, we watch as a the protagonist masters his emotions and comes up gracious and smiling after being dealt a serious blow. As a result, he is often able to go back to the people involved and create an opportunity for himself. However, almost everything else about this movie is, in some way, problematic, including its messages about living out your dream and the benefits of hard work. Pointing out the problems and discussing them will lead to valuable lessons about: (1) the liberties with the facts that can be taken by filmmakers in a movie ""inspired by a true story;"" (2) how the movie makers, in search of a dramatic story line, ignored Mr. Gardner's most important achievement, which was surviving physical and emotional abuse by his stepfather to become a caring and nurturing human being; (3) the victimization of the homeless by criminals; the homeless are at great risk of being assaulted and robbed, but this never made it into the movie; (4) how movies can gloss over troubling ethical questions raised by the true story During the period that Mr. Gardner pursued the internship program his girlfriend had disappeared and taken his son; Mr. Gardner looked for them but couldn't find them; after he had passed the broker's exam and was working as a stockbroker, the girlfriend suddenly appeared and dropped off the boy; Mr. Gardner could have worked for another broker and earned enough money to put a roof over his son's head but Mr. Gardner wanted to spend his time building his own clientele because this would allow him the chance to become rich faster than if he worked for someone else; working to build his own client base meant that Mr. Gardner wouldn't be able to afford a place to live for a year or two; faced with a choice of providing a home for his son and putting off his dream of getting rich or being homeless for almost a year while he tried to build his own client base, Mr. Gardner chose to subject his son to the dangers of homelessness; in other words, he put his own interests ahead of his child's safety; and (5) how ""feel good"" movies often feature Cinderella stories of extraordinary good fortune which, given the economic structure of our society, are unrealistic for all but one in a million [in other words, what does the rags to riches story shown in this movie say to a culturally deprived black or hispanic young person growing up in a central city ghetto who has been socially promoted from one grade to the next and who is not a proficient reader?].",nan,"SUBSTANTIAL. See the Benefits section above. However, with the supplementary materials provided by this Learning Guide, each of these problems can be turned into a benefit.

76,The Chosen,"An injury during a baseball game between two rival Orthodox Jewish schools in New York during World War ll results in an unlikely friendship between Reuven and Danny. Their relationship comes under great strain when their fathers take opposing positions in the intra-Jewish debate over whether to establish a secular Jewish state in Palestine. The story is narrated by Reuven, whose father is a professor arguing for the creation of the state of Israel, but is focused on Danny, an intellectual Hasid who wants to study psychology in a secular university. Danny is pressured mightily by his father, a charismatic Hasidic Rabbi who has raised his son in ""silence"" and expects him to carry on the rabbinical dynasty established generations ago in Poland. Benefits of the Movie: Adapted from the 1967 award-winning novel by Chaim Potok, ""The Chosen"" is a compelling story of friends, fathers and sons, and assimilation into mainstream Western culture. English Language Arts Classes: Often assigned reading in high school ELA classes, the novel on which the movie is based deals with fundamental human values.

Parenting Points:     Unless your child is reading the novel from which the film was adapted in class, enjoy the film with your child and point out how religious tolerance and the nature of friendship and forgiving are important areas of reflection for young people. If your child is reading the novel in class, watch the film after the reading has been completed. Helpful Background The roots of Hasidism, a sect of Judaism, is adequately covered in the novel but is largely absent from the film. It may be useful in classes that do not read the book to require students to read chapter six, in which Reuven Malter's father explains the development of Hasidism. He addresses the split between the Jews in terms of support for the creation of the state of Israel and explains the anger expressed by Rabbi Saunders, Danny's father, who believes that the state of Israel can only be established when the Messiah returns. On this basis, he opposes a secular Jewish state. A number of esoteric terms must be understood, however, for students to follow the film: Hasidim: This term means ""pious ones"" in Hebrew. They are an ultra orthodox sect of Jews who believe in prayer, joy, personal experience, ecstatic prayer, and mysticism. They often express their faith in song and dance. The sect developed in Eastern Europe in the mid-1700s. In the first half of the nineteenth century, when Hasidism was at its height, it was practiced by millions of Jews in Eastern and Central Europe. Torah: The teachings of the Jews consisting of the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Bible. Talmud: The book of commentaries and scriptural interpretations that make up the body of knowledge found in the Torah. Tzaddik: A righteous Jewish man who acts as a mediator between the Jews and their creator. Gematriya: The practice of determining meaning in words by assigning each letter a numerical value which they can be manipulated into new words and altered meaning. Resolution 181: In 1947, the United Nations passed a resolution that partitioned the British Mandate of Palestine into two separate states, one Jewish and the other Arab. Jerusalem and Bethlehem were to fall under international authority. Whereas the Jews accepted the resolution, the Arab majority living in the area did not. At one point in the story Reuven spends the night packing guns in crates marked ""Farm Equipment"". The guns were being sent to the armed Jewish resistance in Palestine. Since the British controlled Palestine and the guns were going to be used against British soldiers, as well as to protect Jews from Arabs, this act was illegal and against stated U.S. government policy. The British considered the armed Jewish resistance, the Irgun and the Hagana, to be terrorists. Aiding and abetting terrorists is clearly illegal.",nan
287,The Paw Project,"Description of the Movie: Dr. Jennifer Conrad is a young veterinarian practicing in California focusing on large exotic cats, many of whom are used in the film industry. She notices that cats, both exotic and domestic, are crippled by declawing. She helps develop a surgical procedure to repair some of the injury suffered by the big cats in her care. However, she soon realizes that 25% of the domestic cats in the U.S. are declawed and that surgery is much too expensive and time consuming to help all of them. She is joined by a few committed volunteers and they organize The Paw Project to campaign against declawing. Their first victory is getting the procedure banned in the City of West Hollywood. The citizen volunteers are surprised when lobbyists of the professional veterinary associations appear and oppose the ban. Apparently, the associations are protecting the interests of veterinarians who make money from the procedure. Through a series of legislative battles, Dr. Conrad and the volunteers of The Paw Project manage to get declawing banned in eight cities in California, including the major population centers of Los Angeles and San Francisco.",pics/poster.png,,13,nan,"Objectives/Student Outcomes Using this Lesson Plan: Students will be shown a vivid example of how a few passionate individuals can influence public policy and lawmaking. They will have an increased understanding of the legislative process, the legal status of local government, the difference between law and regulation, the police power, and the dual role of ""professional associations"" concerned with the financial interests of their members while at the same time being responsible for fostering high standards of practice. Students will understand the role of education, including the use of film, in driving social and political change. The emotional impact of the film will encourage students to give their best efforts to their assignments. The lesson will also lead students to understand that they have obligations to treat animals humanely. Not contained in this lesson plan and only touched upon in the movie are the related topics of lobbying elected officials, grass roots organizing, and the use of social media.",Possible Problems: None.,"Note to Teachers: The vast majority of students will not be active in politics as adults. Many will feel that they are too insignificant or powerless to make a difference. However, at some time in their lives an issue may become important to them. It is therefore helpful for students to know that a few committed people can bring about change in both public opinion and the law. 

The emotional driver for this lesson is an engaging film which shows citizens securing the passage of municipal ordinances to ban the declawing of cats in major cities across California. While not shown in the movie, these individuals have also influenced the passage of three state laws that limit declawing and the adoption of a federal policy prohibiting the declawing of wild and exotic cats. They continue to work to ban all declawing, but due to opposition by powerful national and state veterinary associations, they have not yet reached their goal. 

In the vast majority of U.S. and Canadian jurisdictions veterinarians can still make money declawing cats, a brutal procedure which involves the amputation of the last set of bones in each paw. The operation leaves animals disabled for life and subject to painful chronic infections in their feet. For many declawed cats, every step is a painful ordeal. 

Rationale for the Lesson Plan: See note to teachers, above."

296,Princess Mononoke,"""Princess Mononoke"" is an enthralling epic that elevates anime to art. Most children adore it. The movie is also an environmental wake-up call which attempts to provoke its audience into realizing how much we have already lost and how much more we stand to lose. 1 The story is set in a mythical Japan in the sixteenth century. A boar god has been shot with a bullet made of iron, a substance so incompatible with his nature that its presence in his body turns him into a demon. He attacks a remote village but is killed by its young prince, Ashitaka. The Forest Spirit In the fight, some of the evil that possessed the boar god has attached itself to Ashitaka's arm. The Village Wise Woman tells Ashitaka that soon the evil will overwhelm him and he will die. The only cure can come from the Forest Spirit who lives far away in the deep woods. Taking her advice, Ashitaka leaves his village to find the Forest Spirit. On his journey, he comes across Iron Town, a place where society's outcasts find refuge and acceptance. But the people of Iron Town have destroyed the surrounding forest to make charcoal, a necessary ingredient in the smelting of iron. The animal spirits of the forest have begun to resist and to attack the ironworks. Among them is the mysterious Princess Mononoke, a human girl raised by wolves. The leader of Iron Town, Lady Eboshi, is the person who shot the boar god. She is now bent upon killing the Forest Spirit to protect her people and allow the ironworks to expand.",pics/princess-mononoke-DVDcover.jpg,,12,"""Princess Mononoke"" can be used to make children think about what we are doing to the environment.

The film is also an opportunity to discuss the early history of Japan.",nan,"MODERATE. This film contains violence in which, for example, heads and arms are cleanly lopped off by Ashitaka's arrows. Less extreme violence would have been preferable, however, there are five reasons why we recommend this film despite the violence. First, this is animation. Children have watched cartoon characters kill, maim and destroy each other for generations without ill effect. Second, the violence occurs through the agency of Ashitaka's arm, which not only suffers from the curse of the boar god but, when Ashitaka is provoked, has a god-like strength. It is not the character of Ashitaka who commits the violence, it's the evil that has taken control of his arm. Third, the animation is set in a dim and mythical past and these are not real people. Fourth, we recommend this film for children twelve and up. By that age, unfortunately, most children have seen so much violence in movies and on television that they won't be affected by the cartoon violence in this film. Finally, in all other respects, the film is beneficial.

81,Concussion,"Description: This film is a dramatization of Dr. Bennet Omalu's discovery of CTE. The story told by the movie makers is true in that Dr. Omalu, a pathologist who emigrated to the U.S. from Nigeria, discovered CTE when he performed an autopsy of Pittsburgh Steelers star Mike Webster, the NFL tried to create pseudo-science to dispute the growing evidence that repetitive head trauma led to early onset dementia. The NFL attacked Dr. Omalu and his research but a small group of people believed in Dr. Omalu's work and supported him, and finally, the truth won out as one retired NFL player after another died of early onset dementia. (There are clear parallels between the response of the NFL to CTE and the response of the tobacco companies in the 1950s and 1960s to scientific studies showing that cigarette smoking causes cancer and heart disease.) The major events of Dr. Omalu's life and his character as portrayed in the movie are reasonably accurate. The struggle of the NFL to discredit Dr. Omalu and his research, and the efforts of Dr. Omalu and others who believed that repeated head trauma in football was a causative factor in early onset dementia are telescoped into a few scenes; however, what is shown is consistent with what actually occurred.",pics/dvd-cover.jpg,,13,nan,"Objectives/Student Outcomes Using this Learning Guide: Students will be introduced to the problem of injuries caused by concussion and repeated head trauma in football and other sports. They will learn the mechanism of traumatic brain injury from blows to the head, that even the richest and most powerful corporations cannot always hide the truth, that one person with integrity can make a difference, and the contribution that immigrants make to American society. (These lessons will be even stronger for students read the book.)","Possible Problems: The incident with the FBI raiding the office of Dr. Wecht is incorrect. While Dr. Wecht's office was raided and he was subjected to a politically motivated prosecution from which he was eventually acquitted, the prosecution of Dr. Wecht had nothing to do with Dr. Omalu's discovery of CTE. In addition, we have no information that Dr. Omalu's wife was followed and suffered a miscarriage. These errors are easily corrected. Otherwise, there are no problems with this film from the standpoint of an educator or a parent.","Rationale for Using the Movie: Concussion is a well-written inspiring tale of David vs. Goliath with excellent acting, direction, and cinematography.

As a young boy, Pink suffered from the effects of his father's death in WWII, a distracted and distant mother, and a repressive and unresponsive school system. In the clip, a young Pink tries to express himself in writing, only to be ridiculed by his teacher and his fellow students. He escapes through fantasies of a factory/school in which faceless automaton children are processed on a conveyor belt which takes them to a meat grinder. The students then riot, singing ""We don't need no education"", and burn down the school. When the building is ablaze, they throw the teacher into the flames. This powerful clip contains striking visuals, evocative music, and simple, forceful lyrics. The images are dark, the hopelessness palpable. Note that the themes derived from the clip are different than the theme of the overall film, which focuses on how Pink builds a wall to insulate himself from the pain he experiences in the world.",pics/pink-floyd-the-wall-dvd-cover.jpg,,10,nan,Students will learn a method for determining theme and will write a thematic statement in a paragraph or an essay. They can also be asked to write compositions of various types on topics suggested by the clip.,nan,Deriving theme is an important skill required by most ELA curriculum standards.

301,Refraction and the Green Flash,"The first segment shows the characters of the movie trying to interpret a peculiar navigational chart that is supposed to lead them to the World's End. The chart mentions ""a flash of green"" and an experienced sailor talks about the green flash. The second segment corresponds to the departure of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), who sails off leaving his beloved Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) to await his return. A green flash at sunset marks his disappearance as his ship sails over the horizon.",pics/pirates-of-the-carib-DVDcover.jpg,PH,10,nan,Students will see the principals of optical refraction demonstrated in the elusive green flash and will therefore have better retention of the scientific principles of optics.,nan,The famous green flash is a dramatic and fleeting effect of optical refraction that evokes fascination because it is not easily observed. It has been used in the movie Pirates of the Caribbean – At World's End as a magical moment that signals special events. Its appearance in the movie is a good starting point to introduce the concept of refraction and the physics related to it.
322,Roxanne,"Steve Martin's ""Roxanne"" is a delightful comedic reworking of Cyrano de Bergerac, the 1897 classic play. In both incarnations the story's value lies in its presentation of the conflict between style and substance: the fact that the outward appearance of an individual often masks what lies inside. Charlie D. Bales, initials C.D.B, is a man with a huge nose. He appears to be blustery and brash, yet inside he is sensitive, intelligent, and caring. In addition, Charlie can use words beautifully. Chris, on the other hand, is handsome to the extreme, yet shallow and dull. Roxanne is initially attracted to Chris' beauty but she quickly falls in love when Charlie writes and speaks for the other man. Ultimately, the deception fails, however, in a departure from the original, everyone lives happily ever after. An interesting aspect of ""Roxanne"", which varies considerably from the play, is the development of the female lead. The original Roxanne is beautiful, but lacks depth; she is an object rather than a subject. In Martins remake, Roxanne is an intelligent woman, working on her doctorate in astronomy. She is independent and self directed, rivalling her counterpart in wit and facility with language. Charlie appreciates and acknowledges her substance and character. The other important change from the original is the ending. In the play, when Christian dies in battle, Roxanne sequesters herself in a convent. She is still ignorant of Cyrano's role in her romance with Christian. Cyrano, always the dutiful cousin, visits her every week. Cyrano's enemies take advantage of this custom and, just before the last scene, ambush him as he goes to the convent. Mortally wounded, Cyrano tries to act as if nothing is amiss, but in the last moments of his life the truth of his injury and of his role in Christian's courtship of Roxanne are revealed. Roxanne lives on, knowing that she lost the love of her life, first in the person of Christian and a second time in the person of Cyrano. Thus, there is no opportunity to understand and forgive; the emphasis is on sacrifice and nobility. Martins film updates the story for modern sensibilities, offering resolution and the opportunity for each character to find fulfillment. Even in this unlikely story, Charlie and Roxanne attain a measure of credibility and coherence; they illuminate the difficult movement from awkwardness to intimacy. Benefits of the Movie:     ""Roxanne"" gives young people a lighthearted opportunity to work through important issues they face in a culture which places undue emphasis on outward appearance. Using Martins unique comedic style, the film provokes thought about the pain felt by those who do not measure up to societys conception of beauty and about how they may seek to compensate for their perceived ugliness or disfigurement. As a teaching device the film alone will drive assignments that exercise several of the skills important in English Language Arts.",pics/roxanne-DVD-cover.jpg,,12,"""Roxanne"" gives young people a lighthearted opportunity to work through important issues they face in a culture which places undue emphasis on outward appearance.

185,Hotel Rwanda,"These films describe different aspects of the Rwandan genocide. From April to July 1994, some 927,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu were shot or hacked to death. The perpetrators were the Hutu-dominated army, the Interahamwe militia, and the neighbors and friends of the victims. The international community - in particular, the United States, Western Europe and the U.N. - knew what was going on but stood by and did nothing. 


""Hotel Rwanda"" tells how Paul Rusesabagina protected 1,268 people who took refuge in the Hotel Mille Collines. Like ""Schindler's List,"" this movie paints an inspiring portrait of one man's evolving moral conviction and how, using his wits and charm, he held maniacal killers at bay. 


""Sometimes in April"" has a broader sweep, recounting the stories of many victims of the genocide. In addition, the film describes the situation of three fictional survivors. Martine, a teacher at a Catholic girls' school, lives with the memory of seeing her class massacred. Augustin is a Hutu who had married a Tutsi. His wife and sons were murdered trying to escape. His daughter was a student in Martine's class. Augustin's brother, Honore, was a hate-mongering announcer for Radio RTLM. As the story begins, Honore is on trial before the International War Crimes Tribunal for inciting people to commit genocide. 


""Sometimes in April"" shows the genocide in a series of flashbacks. Scenes of documented atrocities are recreated in the movie, including: the murder of young girls at a Catholic school, Hutu and Tutsi alike, when the Hutu girls refused to give up their Tutsi classmates; the killing of moderate Hutu Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana; and the repatriation of mostly white foreign nationals by French and Belgian troops, leaving a group of Tutsis to their fate at the hands of waiting genocidaires. ""Sometimes in April"" shows the three survivors trying to deal with the effects of the genocide. The film shows a gacaca (pronounced ga-cha-ca), a Truth and Reconciliation style village meeting used to reintegrate low level killers into society without further punishment. It also shows proceedings at the International Criminal Tribunal in Arusha at which the leaders of the Rwandan genocide are being tried for crimes against humanity.",pics/hotel-rwanda-DVD-cover.jpg,HT,14,"Both movies stay very close to the truth. ""Sometimes in April"" paints a more complete picture of the genocide, showing the horror of the hundred days and the difficulty of recovery. The film raises questions of guilt, punishment, forgiveness, and reconciliation that Rwandans must still resolve. ""Hotel Rwanda"" shows less killing and focuses on the uplifting story of an ordinary man who rises to heroic stature under the most frightening circumstances. It is an excellent lesson in courage. ""Hotel Rwanda"" also describes the difficult position of peacekeeping forces when they are not supported by the U.N. and the international community. By focusing on the daring of Mr. Rusesabagina and the survival of the refugees at the Mille Collines, ""Hotel Rwanda"" provides a cushioned introduction to the horrifying subject of the Rwandan genocide. Each of these films will acquaint students with the continuing problem of genocide. After the Holocaust the world said ""Never again."" However, since 1945, humanity has repeatedly stood by and let genocide occur. (At present the world is struggling with a genocide in Darfur.) Both movies can serve as a springboard to discussions on the legacy of colonialism and the challenges facing emerging countries in Africa. Students can explore the history and dynamics of genocide and issues of justice and forgiveness on a personal and national level. These films can also promote discussions of the potential for peacekeeping, as well as the responsibilities of individuals and the media in times of crisis. Possible Problems:     SERIOUS: Both films show the murders of many people. However, there is no gratuitous violence, and care has been taken to avoid making the images too graphic. Scenes of people being killed with machetes are shot from a distance. But depictions of genocide are upsetting. Sensitive children might be disturbed by either of these movies. Both ""Hotel Rwanda"" and ""Sometimes in April"" contain profanity uttered in extreme situations. Parenting Points:     Tell children that each of these movies accurately shows what happened in Rwanda in 1994. Hotel Rwanda focuses on the heroism of one man, and while his heroism is important, the story of the Rwandan genocide is about some 927,000 people being murdered by their countrymen, friends, and neighbors. Immediately after the movie, ask the Quick Discussion Question for that film. Then at odd times over the next week (for example at the dinner table or in the car on the way to school), bring up one of the other Discussion Questions. Don't worry if you can only get through a few questions. Just taking the film seriously and discussing it a little is the key. Allow your children to watch these movies several times on their own if they want.",nan,"SERIOUS: Both films show the murders of many people.

307,A Raisin in the Sun,"Description: Adapted from the play written by Lorrane Hansberry, ""A Raisin in the Sun"" shows the struggle to achieve the American Dream by a poor black family living in Chicago. The matriarch has inherited enough money to make a down payment on a home in a white neighborhood but her son wants to invest the money in a liquor store so that he can better care for his pregnant wife and child in the future. Complications among family members are exacerbated by the resistance of the white residents in the neighborhood of the purchased home.",pics/raisin-in-the-sun-DVDcover.gif,,12,nan,nan,Possible Problems: None.,"Rationale for Using the Movie: The film can be used to introduce the Great Migration, Pan-Africanism and the on-going problem of fair housing in the U.S. The play on which the movies are based is a classic of the American stage.

309,The Red Shoes,"A young dancer is made a star by the world's foremost dance impresario, but she must choose between her art and the man she loves. The film builds on the Hans Christian Anderson fairy tale of the same name. Benefits: ""The Red Shoes"" describes the process by which a ballet is made, highlighting the need for creativity and collaboration among a group of artists. The movie also shows: (1) the glamorous but insular world of a prima ballerina in the first half of the twentieth century; (2) the role of the impresario in the creation of a new ballet and the operation of a ballet company; and (3) the melding of different art forms (music, dance and set design) required for a world class ballet company.

In conjunction with",nan,"MINOR. Absent from this film is an acknowledgment of the hour upon hour of grueling work in technique classes required of a ballet dancer. (This is more clearly seen in The Turning Point and Dancemaker.) The plot of ""The Red Shoes"" is based on the assumption that a woman must choose between a dance career and a fulfilling personal life. As modern prima ballerinas have demonstrated, this is no longer true. Like professional athletes, ballet dancers peak physically in their twenties. Many end their stage careers before the age of forty, leaving them in step with non-dancing contemporaries who have delayed childbearing for their careers. Some ballerinas have been able to have children during their careers. The film ends tragically. Parenting Points:     Before watching the film briefly review with your child the history of the Ballet Russe and the remarkable character of Sergei Diaghilev. See the Helpful Background section.

Most of the children never saw their parents again. The purpose was to break up mixed families, teach the children ""civilized"" ways, and absorb them, culturally and genetically, into white society. This movie is the true story of three young girls who ran away from boarding school at the Moore River Settlement. Living off the land and on handouts, they eluded trackers and the police for months.",pics/rabbit-proof-fence-DVDcover.jpg,,10,"""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" will acquaint children with a shameful chapter of Australian history and invite comparisons to the experiences of other countries, including the United States. For example, the Australian policies bore a striking resemblance to the treatment of Native American children by the U.S. Interesting comparisons can be drawn to the modern day reaction of Australia and the U.S. to these legacies. Other comparisons can be drawn between the Australian government's plan to eliminate half-caste Aborigines through dilution of their Aboriginal genes and the Nazi policies (during the same time period) of eliminating minority populations (Jews, gypsies, political opponents, etc.) through extermination or, in the case of the Poles, limiting their calorie intake to a level that did not permit reproduction.

And if we send someone traveling through space on the machine, who should represent our species? The film is based on Carl Sagan's science fiction novel of the same name. Benefits of the Movie: ""Contact"" raises questions about the relationship between belief in a supreme being and science. It teaches some science and shows a woman scientist in a leadership role. It also addresses questions about truth telling and ethics. Possible Problems:    SERIOUS. The film implies that there is a conflict between science, on the one hand, and belief in a supreme being, on the other. For most religious traditions there is simply no such conflict. Religion and science seek answers to very different questions. See Helpful Background Section below. This issue should be fully discussed with children who see the film. A second assumption embedded in the film that requires comment is the idea that the existence of extraterrestrial life would somehow challenge religious beliefs. For most religions, the concept of the supreme being is universal and would include all beings, including aliens. Again, teachers and parents should think about discussing this assumption. Parents who believe in the literal truth of certain religious texts, e.g., the accounts of creation contained in the Bible, should evaluate this film carefully before showing it to their children.

The film is an excellent platform for the exercise of writing skills and for the analysis of literary devices, such as the expository phase and characterization. This film is considered a classic Western. It features physically beautiful landscapes, the John Wayne image of manhood, and the subtext of similarities between the Indian-hating main character and the renegade Indian he pursues.

88,Courage Under Fire,"Set in the 1991 Desert Storm conflict and its aftermath, this film is the fictional story of the first woman to receive a Medal of Honor for heroism in combat. A subplot concerns the destruction of a U.S. Army tank by friendly fire and its effect on the man responsible. Benefits of the Movie: In addition to exploring the role of women in combat and casualties from friendly fire, this movie contains lessons about alcohol abuse, honesty, redemption, leadership, and the effect of the military macho doctrine of ""I can handle it without help"" on the marriages of army officers. ""Courage Under Fire"" can lead to discussions on these topics. Possible Problems:     SERIOUS. This is a war movie with frequent profanity and some death. The brief view of the tank commander's charred body is gruesome but there is artistic justification for this since the tragedy of his death is a driving force of the plot. Alcohol abuse is shown. The villain, Monfriez, when confronted with his crime, commits suicide by driving his truck into an oncoming train. It should be pointed out to children who see this film that every time Monfriez is called upon to make any moral or life affecting decision, he makes the wrong choice. Parenting Points:     Most children will be interested in discussing several of the lessons presented by this movie. Start by talking about the differences between the actions of Serling and Monfriez. Colonel Serling changes and grows through the story. Monfriez does not. As an example of how Serling grew, ask the Quick Discussion Question. Go over some of the poor decisions made by Monfriez: two of the big ones are lying so that Captain Walden would be left for dead and committing suicide when he was caught. Then go to the Social-Emotional Learning Discussion Questions. Don't worry if you can only get through a few questions.

""Courage Under Fire"" can lead to discussions on these topics.",nan,"SERIOUS. This is a war movie with frequent profanity and some death. The brief view of the tank commander's charred body is gruesome but there is artistic justification for this since the tragedy of his death is a driving force of the plot. Alcohol abuse is shown. The villain, Monfriez, when confronted with his crime, commits suicide by driving his truck into an oncoming train.

336,Seven Days in May,"The time is the Cold War. The President has signed a treaty with the Soviet Union requiring both countries to destroy their nuclear weapons. The polls show the treaty to be unpopular. The charismatic Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff believes that the Soviets will cheat and launch a nuclear surprise attack which would kill hundreds of millions and destroy the United States. He is a man of action .... The plot of this film is not as wild as it seems at first glance. There have been times when the military establishment disagreed strongly with the policy of the President. On at least one occasion, a high ranking military officer defied the Commander in Chief. Douglas MacArthur commanded U.S. troops during the Korean War and was a very popular figure in the U.S. MacArthur sought to expand the conflict to China at the same time that President Truman, intent on avoiding WWIII, worked to limit the scope of the war. Truman promptly fired MacArthur, reasserting civilian control over the military. Another documented occasion of disagreement was during the Cuban Missile Crisis. In 1962 the Soviet Union secretly placed nuclear missiles in Cuba. President Kennedy required the U.S. government to respond in a measured way and did everything he could to avoid nuclear war. The situation was so tense that one misstep could have caused a general war. Many elements in the U.S. military thought that Kennedy was not being aggressive enough. They thought his policy was poor, almost suicidal. They strongly advocated steps that would have led to a general war. Fortunately, on this occasion the military obeyed the Commander in Chief (the President). See Learning Guide to ""Thirteen Days"", which presents the conflict in a somewhat exaggerated fashion. Benefits of the Movie:     This film will help teach children about the constitutional roles of the President, the Senate, and the military. It can also be used as a platform to discuss the intense opposition to the government from certain elements in the political right wing during the Cold War. Possible Problems:     MINOR.

Parenting Points:     The novel and ultimately the movie was created when, as the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. took limited steps to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, right wing ideologues began making irresponsible statements that, if put into practice, would inevitably lead to the destruction of the government.

338,Shall We Dance?,"A Japanese salaryman on the train coming home after a long day's work sees a beautiful woman looking pensively from the window of a ballroom dance studio. Intrigued, he begins to take lessons at the studio and finds something he did not expect. The 2004 U.S. production starring Richard Gere, Jennifer Lopez, and Susan Sarandon is a charming and entertaining movie. Except for the end it pretty much tracks the original Japanese film. However, the U.S. version suffers from the fact that ballroom dancing is not frowned upon in the U.S. The disapproval of the general society gives a sense of risk and mystery to the Japanese film. Benefits of the Movie: This film will show something about life in modern Japan and how people become entranced with dancing, in this case, ballroom dancing. ""Shall We Dance?"" is inevitably compared with Strictly Ballroom. Both films are delightful and worthwhile. ""Shall We Dance?"" deals with the angst of maturity while ""Strictly Ballroom"" explores the challenges of youth. Both movies show dance as a transforming force. Possible Problems: NONE.

89,The Cove,"Description: This is the 2010 Academy Award winning documentary exposing the annual dolphin hunt that occurs at a cove in Taiji, Japan. Dolphins are herded into the cove and trapped there by nets. Some are selected for transfer to dolphinariums throughout the world to be trained to entertain crowds of people. The remainder are slaughtered for their meat.

Discussion questions allow teachers to take most secondary school classes to college level discussions about philosophy and ethics. The worksheet suggested with this Guide will introduce students to the process of evaluating a documentary designed to persuade on an issue of public importance.","Possible Problems: None. While the pictures are not gory (the example shown below is about as bad as it gets), some students may become upset at the way the dolphins are killed.

93,The Crossing,"Description: This film is a dramatization of Washington's victory at Trenton the day after Christmas, 1776. Had Washington not attempted the crossing of the ice-choked Delaware River and had the ill-fed, freezing, poorly trained, and poorly armed Continentals failed to prevail over the feared Hessian mercenaries, the American Revolution would probably have collapsed. This movie presents an account of that battle.",pics/crossing-DVDcover.jpg,,13,nan,"Objectives/Student Outcomes Using this Learning Guide: Students will understand the desperate situation of the Continental Army and of the Revolution in December 1776 and the pivotal role of the Battle of Trenton in saving the Revolution. The film provides opportunities for students to exercise reading, research, thinking and writing skills.","Possible Problems: Several: Substantial historical inaccuracies are described in the Helpful Background Section in the Supplemental Materials. On the whole, however, the movie conveys an accurate picture of the plight of the Continental Army in December of 1776 and the difficulties faced by George Washington in leading the army. There is a moderate amount of blood and violence in the war scenes and a substantial amount of profanity throughout the film.","Rationale for Using the Movie: The film shows a key event in the Revolutionary War and gives students a glimpse of one of those extraordinary battles in which a few determined soldiers changed the course of history. It shows some of the difficulties in a revolution against the powerful forces of the British Empire. The movie humanizes George Washington, often seen as distant and aloof, as he contends with vastly superior British forces."
340,Shiloh,"Marty is eleven years old and lives in the mountains of West Virginia. He develops an attachment to a beagle hunting dog who has twice run away from an abusive owner. Marty names the dog Shiloh and desperately tries to find a way to keep him. These efforts lead Marty to secrets, lies and confusion over right and wrong. Instead of returning the dog to his owner, Marty hides Shiloh in an old shed and lies to everyone when asked if he has seen the dog. Although Marty's family is on a tight budget and his father has said that they can't afford to feed a dog, Marty sneaks food to Shiloh. The shed does not provide Shiloh with adequate protection. One night, Shiloh is badly mauled by a much larger dog and Marty's lies are exposed. However, through an unexpected stroke of luck, combined with courage, perseverance, and hard work, Marty eventually convinces the once abusive owner to sell him the dog. Unfortunately, this also requires that Marty lie one more time to his parents. Benefits of the Movie:     The film can serve as a treat or reward after students have read the novel. The Possible Problems section will discuss how to turn the substantial problems with the story (both the book and the movie) into a strength. ""Shiloh"" is a compelling story of a child falling in love with an animal and doing what he has to do to save the animal from an abusive situation. The story is realistic and there is much that rings true. In fact, one of the authors of this Learning Guide lived this story in part; but there was no opportunity to lie and the ending was tragic for the dog, a beautiful German shepherd named Dan.",pics/shiloh-DVDcover.jpg,,10,"The film can serve as a treat or reward after students have read the novel.

The story is realistic and there is much that rings true. In fact, one of the authors of this Learning Guide lived this story in part; but there was no opportunity to lie and the ending was tragic for the dog, a beautiful German shepherd named Dan.",nan,"SUBSTANTIAL. There are major problems with the book and the movie. In both, Marty repeatedly rationalizes lying to serve his own interests. One of the lies is made to his parents at the request of an adult. It is extremely dangerous for children to lie to their parents at the behest of another adult. (The novel won the Newberry Award. TWM cannot understand why this award was given to a book whose hero accomplishes his goals by lying.) A second and less important problem is that the story shows mountain people in West Virginia defying the laws concerning hunting and cruelty to animals. Adults suggesting the book or the movie should take the time to turn the story's substantial problems with lying into strengths. Benefits can be found in pondering the great value of honesty and the special dangers to children when they lie to parents at the request of another adult. As to the value of honesty, the question comes down to whether being honest would result in the sacrifice of a greater good. Good cause or bad, a lie is a lie. Only in extreme circumstances, when the good to be achieved is important and the lie is the only way to secure that good, can an ethical person lie. In addition, when the lie will benefit the liar, one must be careful of making rationalizations to justify the result desired. A person in Marty's position had to make an objective determination that the good to be achieved, without his own interests being considered, justified the lie. Specifically, before Marty could justify lying about Shiloh's whereabouts he had to make sure that the benefit to Shiloh was sufficient to permit an ethical lie and that the only effective way to protect Shiloh was for Marty to keep him. A good argument can be made that in the circumstances of this story, the only way to protect Shiloh was for Marty to become his master. However, when a person lies, he or she takes responsibility for the situation. In this story, Marty got in over his head because he didn't have the resources to protect Shiloh during the night. As a result, Shiloh was attacked by a larger dog and suffered injuries that Judd Travers contended he would never have inflicted. As for the last lie that Marty tells, the lie to his parents about why Judd Travers changed his mind and let Marty buy the dog, Marty clearly makes the wrong decision. The risks of lying to parents at the request of another adult are obvious, as demonstrated by the plight of the millions of children who have been sexually abused and then at the demand of the abuser, withhold the information from their parents, permitting the abuse to continue. Most kids cannot compete in experience or cunning with an adult who tries to induce them to lie to their parents.",nan

344,Small Wonders,"This documentary entrances and inspires music students ages 6 - 16, by showing children their own age anxious to play the violin, willing to practice, and willing to work hard to live up to their teacher's stringent standards. The setting is the New York City School system in the late 1980s and early 1990s. As in many parts of the country, public schools are being forced to drastically reduce spending on arts and music education. Roberta Guaspari has created an innovative violin program at three elementary schools in East Harlem. When funding cuts force the school board to eliminate her program, she doesn't accept her fate and fade away. Instead, Ms. Guaspari, the parents of her students, other teachers, and public minded citizens create their own nonprofit foundation so that instruction in the violin can continue. To raise money for the program, the parents and their allies organize a concert at Carnegie Hall in which masters such as Isaac Stern, Itzhak Perlman, Arnold Steinhardt, and country fiddler Mark O'Connor, perform alongside the young students. ""Small Wonders"" documents this story and shows violin students as young as six years of age practicing, taking class and performing.",pics/small-wonders-DVDcover.jpg,,6,"Watching this film will help children who play musical instruments acquire the discipline to practice.

The East Harlem Violin Program has expanded to three violin teachers and one cello instructor. Its student body is 36% African American and 60% Latino. Many of its students continue their music study in the Interschool Orchestras of New York, the Julliard School of Music Advancement Program, and the Harlem Schools for the Arts. In addition to Carnegie Hall, the students from this program have performed at the White House, the Kennedy Center, in Germany, Switzerland, and many other locations. Demand for the program still exceeds the space available and the lottery is still used to select students. 50% of the applicants are turned away. What began as an effort to protect the job of an innovative and inspiring teacher is now a nonprofit organization with broader goals. Opus 118 - We Want Music! has plans that include promoting outstanding teaching efforts in other New York City schools, offering after school and weekend lessons to dedicated students, and a concert series to expose students to great musical performers. Its ""Outstanding String Teachers Initiative"" seeks to train music teachers in the group teaching methodology pioneered by Roberta Guaspari, along with developing skills in program development, community-parent organization, relations with elected officials, and public-private interaction. Opus 118 - We Want Music! has proposed several other initiatives designed to promote music education nationally. Roberta Guaspari studied violin in the public schools and went on to major in Music Education in college. She holds a Masters Degree in Music Education from Boston University.

The film, while banned in China, still suffers from the effort to get it past the Chinese government censors. Reports that we have received from American citizens born in China who returned home for visits during the period shown by this film are that the police state has made each person distrustful of others, including family members. There would be, they report to us, no conversations of any substantive matters because of this distrust. The film only hints at this. There is some blood in this movie, but little violence. We briefly see the bloody corpse of the couple's son after he has been run over by a car. We are shown the blood from the daughter's hemorrhage on the hospital bed clothes but do not see the daughter in these scenes. These scenes help convey the message of the film.",nan

Dustin Hoffman said that ""Tootsie"" is about a man becoming a better man by experiencing what it's like to be a woman. The film explores the different ways in which people act and the different ways that they perceive life, based on their gender. It also leads viewers to think about some of the differences and similarities between men and women. The film is excellent for teaching boys not to mistreat girls and for teaching girls to be less tolerant of male misbehavior. Certain scenes in ""Tootsie,"" like Shakespeare's wonderful comedy Twelfth Night, explore the nature of attraction between people of the same and different sexes. Possible Problems:    MODERATE. There is frequent profanity. Michael sleeps with a woman that he has known for a long time. It doesn't work and they both regret it. Fortunately they remain friends. This is a minor event in the film. Some view this film as flawed because the major female characters, Sandy and Julie, permit themselves to be mistreated by men.

Critics of this film point out that in its efforts to show the Japanese side of the war, the film whitewashes the naked aggression of the Japanese Empire. This can easily be corrected by a few comments from the adult showing the film. Parenting Points:     The unprovoked sneak attack on Pearl Harbor is a black mark against the Japanese nation that will endure for many years.

Betty and Jim Bennett agree to host one of these ""Hiroshima Maidens"". Their guest, Miyeko, delights their youngest son, Timmy. The older boy, Johnny (approximately age ten), and his friends pick up on the suspicion of one of the Bennett's neighbors, an embittered veteran of brutal jungle fighting against the Japanese. Initially, Johnny is suspicious and fearful of the ""Jap spy"". Later, he comes to appreciate Miyeko's humanity. He must chose between the prejudice of his friends and the loving attitude of his family.",pics/hiroshima-maiden-VHS-cover.jpg,HT,9,"This film operates effectively on at least five levels. First, it shows a child of about ten choosing between the prejudice of his peers and the ethics and loving attitude of his family. Second, it shows adults dealing with the still raw wounds of a brutal war. Third, it brings home the human cost of war and the terrible meaning of the terms ""collateral damage"" and ""civilian casualties"". Fourth, it is an introduction to the injuries visited upon innocents in the only nuclear war experienced by mankind. This is a story of the compassion of an American family and the courage of a young woman who travels half-way across the world for painful surgeries in a land that had been the hated enemy of her country. While other movies about the atomic attacks on Japan can be quite grisly and graphic, this film is gentle. Nevertheless, the human cost of war, particularly the impact on its youngest victims, is underscored by the angry, swollen scars that mar the left side of Miyeko's body. The fifth and perhaps the most important level on which this movie works can be shown by following the story of the Hiroshima Maidens as they took the experience of their stay in the U.S. back to their homes in Japan. It is an enduring testament to the transforming and healing power of love. See section on The Lasting Effects of the Maidens' Stay in the U.S. and Discussion Question #3.",nan,"MINOR. The largest problem with this film is that it is obviously a mid-20th century production and students may consider the production values to be low.

The acting illuminates the language and viewers can easily follow the plot. The play is a romp, full of fun and lyric speeches.

This movie includes popular songs such as ""Tradition,"" ""Matchmaker, Matchmaker,"" ""To Life,"" ""Miracle of Miracles,"" ""Sunrise, Sunset"" and ""If I Were a Rich Man.""",nan,"MODERATE. Tevye's decision to reject Chava might make some children nervous about possible rejection by their own parents and send the wrong message about parenting. When showing this movie to young children parents should remark on the fact that Tevye's decision to reject Chava for marrying a Christian was wrong because it placed tradition, prejudice, and religion before a parent's love for a child. When showing this movie to older children ask the Quick Discussion Question and make sure that children understand the answer. There are many stereotypes of Jewish characters but they are all lovingly portrayed. There is one scene in which Tevye, Lazar Wolf and the other male villagers get roaring drunk and have a good time. Parenting Points:     For younger children this musical is all about the music and the dancing. For children 10 - 12, just point out how Tevye departed from tradition in allowing his first two daughters to marry the men they loved. For older children ask and help them to answer the Quick Discussion Question. Other good discussion questions for parents to review with their children are #s 5 and 8.

129,Historical Fiction,"SELECTING THE FILM: TWM recommends selecting movies for both artistic merit and relative historical accuracy. Teachers should be seen as role models who insist upon quality in the media they present. For some students, watching films in class or as homework will be their first exposure to movies of excellence. TWM provides suggested historical fiction film lists for American History and World History.",,,0,nan,nan,nan,"Today's adults usually become acquainted with events from the past through movies that are works of historical fiction. However, feature films that deal with historical topics are in fact stories with protagonists, antagonists, conflicts, resolution, characters with various personality traits, and other literary elements and devices. Often, filmmakers introduce major factual errors in the interests of telling a better story. (An example of this is the movie Selma.) TWM contends that an important part of both social studies and ELA instruction is to give students the analytical tools to recognize historical fiction in film and to analyze it as a work of fiction. These are skills that will benefit students throughout their lives."

190,Inherit the Wind,"This drama is loosely based on the ""Scopes Monkey Trial,"" Dayton, Tennessee, 1925. However, the inspiring event for ""Inherit the Wind"" was the red scare of the late 1940s and early 1950s and the excesses of redbaiters such as Senator Joseph McCarthy and the House UnAmerican Activities Committee. Therefore the ""trial"" in the film departs to some extent from the historical record. The movie is based on a play by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee which opened in 1955. The play and the films based on the play have come to symbolize the Scopes trial in the national consciousness of the United States.

As the movie opens, the audience is introduced to Mark Bellison, a slightly overweight young man with a pug nose who is unsuccessful at work and unlucky in love. In short order, Mark is rejected by a beautiful woman, gets fired from his job, and is about to be evicted from his apartment.

There are several subplots: the boys are recruited by a patent medicine maker to peddle his brew to the neighbors, they test it on their mother and almost kill her; the boys blow up part of the house with an ""invention;"" they get into scrapes with a girl and so on. The mother and father have hilarious contretemps about visits by her relatives and the mother's anxiety over the father's refusal to be baptized. ""Life With Father"" spoofs everything it can reach including religious orthodoxy, superstition, and authoritarian fathers. The film is based on the successful Broadway play by Linsday Howard and Russell Crouse which in turn was based on a novel of the same name.

There is no gore and, in fact, the full horror of war is not shown. The movie was made in 1962 at the height of the Cold War when the U.S. valued its West German ally. It gives a very sympathetic view of the German army, ignoring its complicity in many of the atrocities of the Nazi regime and the murder by SS Troops of Allied soldiers taken prisoner during the Normandy invasion.

230,A Man for All Seasons,"This film depicts the events leading to the martyrdom of Sir Thomas More (1478-1525). More was a judge and a royal official, as well as an author and a leading figure of the Renaissance. More was beheaded by King Henry VIII because he opposed Henry's actions in taking control of the Church in England, thereby separating it from the Catholic Church.

It introduces Sir Thomas More, a most extraordinary man. The film also provides an introduction to the history of England in the sixteenth century.",nan,"SERIOUS. This film presents a limited and uncritical view of Sir Thomas More. Because of its inaccuracies and omissions, the film has been strongly criticized by Richard Marius, author of a respected biography of More. Several years ago, based on Marius' criticisms, we declined to prepare a Learning Guide for this film. However, many people disagreed with us and felt that the story of a man who gave up everything for a principle could serve as a valuable teaching tool. In addition, we are informed that the film is widely used for this purpose by teachers in England. After reading several biographies of More and much reflection, we agree with both the proponents and the critics of this film. As a result of its historical inaccuracies ""A Man for All Seasons"" is not a film to simply show or recommend with the implication that ""this is the way it was."" There is too much here that is the way it wasn't, or at least there is too much that is the subject of controversy among historians. However, the film can become a useful teaching tool if some of the inaccuracies and omissions are brought out and discussed. In addition, the real Thomas More was one of the most interesting and, with the exception of his persecution of heretics, one of the most admirable men who ever lived. Educated people should know of his career, his literary works, and his martyrdom.

5,"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea","This science fiction classic contains the story of Captain Nemo and the crew of the Nautilus which was an atomic submarine. This wouldn't appear to be science fiction in our day and age. However, the story takes place in the second half of the 19th century.

Benefits of the Movie: Written when submarines and atomic energy were only fantasies, this fast-paced adventure demonstrates how the future can be predicted by well-conceived science fiction.

The meaning of the word has changed over time and is now considered offensive hate speech or, ironically, a cool part of hip hop culture. The character of Jim is somewhat stereotyped as an ignorant slave but he is also shown as a father who wants to be reunited with his family.","Rationale for Using the Movie: Mark Twain's novel The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn reveals the process by which a boy comes to the realization that despite the teachings of peers and elders, slavery is wrong and that true friendship transcends race and age.

15,Amadeus,"Antonio Salieri was a contemporary of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756 - 1791). An accomplished musician, Salieri competed with Mozart for recognition and employment. This film is a fictional exploration of how Salieri might have felt when he realized that despite all his hard work, talent, and popularity at the time, he could not hope to approach Mozart's genius. Driven out of his mind by jealously, Salieri is confined to an insane asylum, and fantasizes that he has killed Mozart.",pics/amadeus-DVDcover.jpg,LT,12,"""Amadeus"" provides a thoughtful exploration of an existential and moral dilemma: if you are talented, if you spend years in training, if you work hard and if you are acclaimed by your peers for your achievements, how do you react when faced with true genius that easily outshines anything you can hope to accomplish, especially when that genius takes the form of a vulgar little imp? The movie also explores the concept of music as the voice of God, a recurrent theme in Western civilization. In the meantime we learn much about the life of Mozart and get a glimpse of aristocratic life in Vienna in the late 18th century. Throughout the film we are treated to Mozart's splendid music. Possible Problems:    MINOR. ""Amadeus"" is not history. While Salieri and Mozart were rivals in some respects, Salieri did not pay Mozart for a requiem that Salieri could pass off as his own. Someone else did that. Nor was Salieri implicated in Mozart's death, which was from natural causes. ""Amadeus"" is a creative work about the jealousy, rage, and cosmic betrayal felt by some talented and accomplished human beings who have not been graced with true genius. The movie opens with Salieri, razor in hand, just after he has attempted to slit his own throat. It is a fleeting and moderately bloody scene. Salieri's suicide attempt is not a success and he is not shown as a role model in the movie. Mozart is shown as an immature, puerile individual who delights in puns and riddles with sexual innuendos. Mild profanity is used on occasion in this film. Mozart drinks far too much wine. He was probably, as shown in the film, an alcoholic. His alcohol abuse is shown as contributing to his death.

It also shows the central role of evangelical religion in the lives of the miners, the isolation of the West Virginia coal towns, the difficulties of organizing a union, and the brutality of the coal companies. Joe Kinehan is a role model for a committed and patient social activist. Possible Problems:     MODERATE. There are a number of beatings and shootings shown. Some are moderately graphic but all are tied to the story line. Alcohol use is shown in a negative light when the company spy uses it to cloud the judgment of a girl he persuades to falsely charge Kinehan with rape. This film takes a pro-union position with respect to the attempts to unionize the coal fields at the beginning of the 20th century.

283,Partners of the Heart,"These films describe the unique and productive association between Vivien Thomas, a black high school graduate, and his white mentor and employer, Dr. Alfred Blalock. For more than 30 years, the two men pursued a variety of medical research projects. In 1944, in association with Dr. Helen Taussig, they designed and carried out the first blue baby operations. These procedures have saved tens of thousands of lives world-wide. The success of the blue baby operations confirmed that surgeons could operate on a living human heart. Afterwards, Thomas trained young doctors at Johns Hopkins Medical School in methods of heart surgery. While a mid-20th century interracial partnership in the field of medical research and an important medical breakthrough are each worthy of note, there is much more to this story. Vivien Thomas fully participated in developing the blue baby operations, but he was not given credit for his contribution nor was he acknowledged to be a leading instructor of surgery for more than three decades. Why it took so long for Thomas to receive the recognition he deserved provides an excellent window into changing attitudes concerning race in the U.S. during the 20th century. ""Something the Lord Made"" is a fictionalized account that accurately conveys the sense of the actual events. ""Partners of the Heart"" is an excellent PBS documentary.",pics/something-the-lord-made-DVDcover.jpg,BL,10,The story of Vivien Thomas and Alfred Blalock is an excellent paradigm with which to study racism in the United States during the period 1930 - 1980.

Hester's husband has been missing for years and is presumed dead. She has a secret love affair with a minister and becomes pregnant. Obviously guilty of adultery but unwilling to name the father of her child, Hester faces the condemnation of the community.

269,The Official Story,"The place is Argentina. The time is during the Dirty War of the late 1970s and early 1980s. A mother is painfully and inescapably driven to find her adopted daughter's origins. The truth illuminates one of the awful secrets of Argentine history. Benefits of the Movie: This movie is a sensitive and intense exploration of moral character which is paralleled by the viewer's initiation into the consequences of a decision by a country's military junta to torture, murder and make its opponents ""disappear."" The film also introduces us to a critical period in recent Argentine history. Before showing this film to children you should describe the political situation in Argentina during the 1970s and at least tell them that: During much of the 20th century, Argentina suffered from political instability. From 1976 to 1983, it was ruled by a ruthless right wing military junta that imprisoned tens of thousands of people suspected of opposition to the regime. There was no trial or due process. People would simply ""disappear."" Many were tortured. About 30,000 of the ""disappeareds"" were never heard from again. One of the hidden atrocities committed by the junta was that pregnant prisoners were allowed to give birth before they were killed. The babies were not returned to the families of the victims but instead were given to friends of the regime who wanted to adopt a child. Possible Problems:    SERIOUS. The wife/mother is briefly but brutally beaten by her husband at the end of the movie. Some alcohol abuse is shown but it is not portrayed as a positive.

265,Isaac Newton: A Tale of Two Isaacs,"This movie combines the story of Isaac Newton with that of a fictional assistant who must leave the girl he loves to accompany Newton to Cambridge University. ""Newton: A Tale of Two Isaacs"" is one of the ""Inventors' Specials,"" an award-winning series of films designed to introduce children to great scientists and inventors.",pics/newton-inventors-VHScover.jpg,PH,8,"This film will introduce children to Isaac Newton, his discoveries and his time.",nan,"MODERATE. Isaac Newton was not a man who needed a shield from everyday life. After the period of his scientific discoveries, Newton was an active public servant, elected to Parliament and appointed to be Master of the Royal Mint. We question the accuracy of this film's presentation of Newton as an absent-minded professor type. Parenting Points:     Tell your children that the way that we look at our world was shaped by Isaac Newton. With his three laws of motion, Newton explained how and why objects move the way they do. inertia: an object at rest will remain at rest and an object in motion will move in a straight line at the same speed unless acted upon by a force; the change in the speed or direction of an object is: in the same direction as the force exerted; directly proportional to the net force exerted; and inversely proportional to the object's mass; and for every action, there is an opposite and equal reaction. It was not until Einstein published his theory of relativity, some 200 years later, that scientists came up with new laws of motion that take account of differences too small to affect every day life. But Newton's three laws are still used to describe the observable actions of objects in our world. Newton was the first to accurately describe gravity as being a force of attraction exerted by large objects on small objects. People knew that things fell toward the earth but they didn't know why. Newton was the first to apply the laws of motion and gravity to outer space. People had no idea why the moon stayed near the earth but didn't come crashing down onto the earth. Newton showed them why. (It has a forward movement but it is pulled to the earth by gravity. An orbit around the earth takes into account both forces.) People had no idea why the planets circled the sun. (Also gravity and forward momentum.) Newton made many other discoveries some of which are described in the Helpful Background section.

They have the support of their science teacher and Homer's mother, who is determined that her son will not end up as a miner. Against all odds, the boys win the national science fair with an entry describing their rockets. All of the boys go to college, something unusual in coal country at the time.

The movie shows the positive influence teachers can have on their students, a mother's support for her child's dreams, the love of a son for his father and his need for his father's approval, as well as the value of people who are different from most of us. The fact that the film is based on a true story adds emphasis to these lessons.",nan,"MINOR. The movie contains mild profanity used in stressful situations.

Review the points made in Before Watching the Movie. When the movie is over, review with your child what is true and what isn't true. See After Watching the Movie. When your child is ready to read the book, get it for him or her from the library. It's better than the movie. The movie teaches important lessons in social-emotional learning. It shows that a child with a dream can go far beyond family expectations. This concept is stressed in the film and parents can reinforce it by commenting on the theme or by giving examples of people known to the child who have done something with their lives that was much different than what was expected of them. Also stressed in the movie is the concept that children can prevail over daunting odds. A parental comment about how great it was that these kids didn't give up will help stress this idea. In addition, the movie tells us that most often excellence is the result of a community effort or at least comes with the help of many people, as it did in this case. Parents can explore this issue by asking and helping their child to answer the Quick Discussion Question.

When the ship was seized on the high seas by a U.S. Navy vessel, abolitionists filed a court case to free the Africans. The trial and subsequent appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court highlighted to the public the evils of slavery and is seen as a major step toward turning the North against the South's ""peculiar institution.""

At first submissive and treated as a slave by the man she was forced to marry, Celie grows in relationships with the women in her life who show her love and respect. She becomes assertive as she develops self-esteem and the burdens of her past are lifted. Most of the events in the story center upon associations among black people rather than the interaction between blacks and whites. It thus reveals African-American culture as more than a reaction to white oppression.

100,Dancemaker,"This documentary covers a year in the life of the Paul Taylor Dance Company. It features: the creation of a new dance; endless rehearsals; funding the company; touring India; all leading up to the company's New York season. Benefits of the Movie: ""Dancemaker"" shows dance as a collaborative art. It highlights the cooperating, yet in some measure opposing, forces which are harnessed to make a dance company: art/money; dancers/choreographers; dancers/management; the limits of the human body/the demands of the art; passion/practicality. Mr. Taylor, the dancers, and the company manager talk intimately about their lives and their work. Possible Problems: MINOR. ""Dancemaker"" approaches Paul Taylor in an essentially uncritical light and has been called ""almost propaganda"" by some reviewers. As one reviewer said: At least a couple of times we are treated to the claim that Taylor is the greatest choreographer of modern dance. Why is such an absolute assertion necessary? It immediately raises questions in the viewer's mind. What about Taylor's teacher, Martha Graham? And is Mark Morris chopped liver? Isn't it good enough to be one of the greatest, without laying claim (and opening a meaningless argument) to being number one? Once the claim is made, too, it puts the filmmaker on the spot to prove it in his film, an impossible task. -- Arthur Lazere, Culturevulture.net Parenting Points:     Children who are interested in dance will adore this movie.

Research and writing assignments in pursuit of these topics can be of great benefit in the study of the conflict that cost more American lives than any other.,"Possible Problems: Portions of the film graphically show the violence of the Civil War and the suffering of the soldiers. However, the violence is not gratuitous in its depiction of the horrors that the soldiers would experience in battle.","Rationale for Using the Movie: After an extensive review of the Colonel Shaw's letters, TWM estimates that the movie is 90% historically accurate. The film addresses a significant episode in U.S. history, the effort by abolitionists to make the Civil War into a war to end slavery, rather than just a war to preserve the Union. The fact that black men would take up arms and fight and die on the Union side was a major step in changing Northern attitudes toward slavery and the purpose of the war. The assault on Fort Wagner in which the Massachusetts 54th lost hundreds of men was ""a turning point in recognition of blacks' capacity to serve in the army"". Foner pp. 251 - 253."

She was the first person to record the social structure of African mountain gorillas, interact with them, and form strong affectionate bonds with separate individuals. Gradually, Fossey moved from fascinated observer to passionately aggressive conservationist, determined to protect ""her"" gorillas at all costs. Acting almost alone, she saved them from extinction. Today the mountain gorillas are still threatened by habitat destruction, but their numbers have increased. Fossey brought their plight to the attention of the entire world, making an enormous contribution to the animal protection and ecology movements.",pics/gorillas-in-the-mist-DVDcover.jpg,BL,13,"""Gorillas in the Mist"" is an excellent and motivating introduction to primatology, gorillas, and Africa. The movie recreates the wonderful scene in which Fossey becomes the first human being to affectionately communicate with a mountain gorilla in the wild. The movie shows how one person protected an entire species of magnificent animals from extinction. The movie also shows the dark side of Dian Fossey, how her utter devotion to the cause of the gorillas, combined with isolation and frustration, ultimately led her to use abusive and extreme tactics. ""Gorillas in the Mist"" is an excellent study in the nature and risks of obsession. The movie can also serve to interest children in the ""trimates,"" Fossey and two other women who became identified with the study of the great apes. They are Jane Goodall, who studied the chimpanzees of Tanzania, and Birute Galdikas, less widely known, who did the same for the orangutans of Borneo. Each of these women conducted pioneering research and forged almost miraculous connections with individual animals.",nan,"SERIOUS. Fossey takes up with a married man and neither of them show any remorse. See discussion question on fidelity in this film. The movie contains scenes of Fossey and her friend hugging and kissing, in bed after making love and in a bath together. No ""objectionable"" body parts are shown, being hidden by clothing, bed clothes or water and suds. There are gory views of massacred gorillas and a scene in which Fossey psychologically tortures a child caught while accompanying his father on a poaching mission. Fossey shows no respect for others when she is provoked. After Digit, her favorite gorilla, is decapitated by poachers, Fossey subjects one to a mock hanging and burns huts in the poachers' village. She is also shown breaking into a van carrying captured animals to seize a captive baby gorilla legally purchased by a trader for a zoo in Europe. Garden variety profanity occurs on about ten occasions in the film. There are also some distortions of the historical record but the essential elements are accurately presented. See Note on Historical Accuracy in the Helpful Background Section. Parenting Points:     Allow your children to enjoy watching this sensitive and determined woman interact with gorillas and after the film is over ask them what animals they would want to work with, were able to get to know animals in the wild. What do they think it would be like to meet their chosen animals in the wild? Ask and help your child to answer the Quick Discussion Questions.",nan

165,The Great Dictator,"""The best Chaplin movie ever!"" said a ten-year-old World War II buff. The names indicate the fun in store for anyone who sees this film: Tomania (as in ptomaine poisoning) = Nazi Germany Adenoid Hynkel (""Heil Hynkel"") = Hitler Bacteria = Fascist Italy Benzino Napaloni = Mussolini Garbitsch (pronounced ""garbage"") = Göebbels Herring = Göring The sign of the ""double cross"" = Swastika Chaplin plays Hynkel, a dictator with a ""Charlie Chaplin moustache"" who looks and acts like Hitler. Chaplin also plays a Jewish barber who was a hero in the ""Tomanian"" Army during the previous war (World War I) and who looks exactly like Hynkel. This movie is a farce but the last speech is quite serious. The humor in this film will be appreciated most by children who have a basic understanding of World War II and of the threat to Western Civilization posed by Hitler, Mussolini, Göebbels and Göring.",pics/great-dictator-DVDcover.jpg,HT,10,"This movie makes history hilarious. It will confirm the understanding of the events leading up to WWII for those children who already have a background in the history of that time. The film also contains sequences of great humor and poetry. The scene with Hitler and the globe is one of the most memorable on film. ""The Great Dictator"" will provide an opportunity for parents or teachers to explain many of the events leading up to World War II and the personalities of the men who started the war.",nan,"MINOR. The scenes of the concentration camp are naively benign. When this movie was made most people in the United States did not know about the actual conditions in the concentration camps or that the German government planned to murder millions of people. Children watching this film should be told that the concentration camps were much worse than they are depicted in this film. The actual conditions in the camps, why Chaplin didn't know about them, and who actually did know about the treatment of the Jews and other prisoners are good topics for discussion. Parenting Points:     If your child knows a lot about WWII, and the monstrous crimes perpetrated by Hitler and those around him, tell him or her that this movie was made in 1941 before the U.S. entered WWII and when Nazi atrocities were not known in the U.S. For example the portrayal of concentration camp in this movie does not show their horror. Charlie Chaplin was Jewish and very left-wing, if not a Communist. He hated everything Hitler stood for. To add insult to injury, Hitler copied the Little Tramp's moustache. If your child doesn't know a lot about WWII, describe to them the brutal atrocities committed by the killers ridiculed in this film and how they claimed to be statesmen and the proponents of a new order in the world. As Chaplin points out, they were just thugs. Ask and help your child to answer the Quick Discussion Question.",nan

43,Behind the Sun,"The year is 1910; the place is the sertão, the semi-arid inland area of Northeastern Brazil. 20-year-old Tonio is the middle son of an impoverished farm family, the Breves. He is next in line to kill and then be killed in an ongoing blood feud with a neighboring clan, the Ferreiras. For generations, the two families have quarreled over land. Now they are locked in a series of tit-for-tat assassinations of their sons: an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth — a life for a life. Embedded in this choreography of death is a particular code of ethics: ""Blood has the same volume for everyone. You have no right to take more blood than was taken from you."" The world of this movie is suffused with a sense of futility and stoic despair.

Under pressure from his father, Tonio kills a Ferreira son to avenge the murder of Tonio's older brother. This act marks him as the next victim. Tonio's younger brother is addressed only as ""the Kid"" by the family. Anticipating future loss, his parents haven't given him a name. The Kid is an imaginative and loving child, whose spirit will not break in the face of harsh parenting, brutalizing isolation, and numbing poverty. The Kid's love encourages Tonio to question his fate. When Tonio meets Clara, a charming itinerant circus girl, he gets a glimpse of life's possibilities. Will he be able to escape the cycle of human sacrifice on the alter of revenge? Can the cycle be broken?

The inspiration for the movie was the novel Broken April, by Ismail Kadare, which describes a blood feud in the mountains of Albania. The message is universal.",pics/behind-the-sun-DVDcover.jpg,,12,"This film is useful in teaching: (1) some of the reasons why revenge has been rejected by modern developed societies and the rule of law adopted instead; (2) the international scope and moral bankruptcy of honor cultures; and (3) the literary devices of symbolism, motif, subplot, foreshadowing, and flashback. This",nan,"MINOR. There is a brief, tender, and tasteful scene of lovemaking. There is no gore and no gratuitous violence. Parenting Points:     This entry is extensive, but the benefits of introducing children to honor cultures are substantial. Before watching ""Behind the Sun,"" tell your children that the people in the movie are living in an ""honor culture"" in which feelings of personal worth and social status depend upon how closely they adhere to a code which requires that they exact revenge on people seen as having dishonored them or their family. Honor cultures can be found all over the world. For the most part, Western societies have moved beyond honor culture values that survive only in some subcultures, such as gangs, and in a few countries of Southeast Europe and some parts of Latin America. After watching the film, tell your children the following: In modern society the impulse for revenge is replaced by going to court and seeking justice. For example: ""If someone hurts a member of our family, we call the police and ask the government to take them to court, rather than trying to settle the score with violence."" In modern Western cultures, people act according to standards of right conduct set out in ethical rules like the Golden Rule, the Ten Commandments, or the Six Pillars of Character. Forgiveness is a strongly held value. These values are internalized (hopefully) in our consciences. People who do not act ethically are not held in high esteem. Honor cultures, on the other hand, are not governed by ideas of what is right or wrong. A man's sense of self-worth and his status in society come from how strongly he defends his honor and the honor of his family. In honor cultures, prestige lies in how closely a man adheres to a code, which can be written or handed down verbally from generation to generation, that regulates how to take revenge on people seen as dishonoring the man or his family. If your children are interested in these issues, you can ask and help them to answer Discussion Questions #s 9 - 14 and Question #1 under the Social-Emotional Learning topic ""Revenge."" Then ask and take your children through the answer to the Quick Discussion Question. Tell them that the institution in our society that substitutes for revenge is the court system. Finally, repeat the difference between modern Western societies and honor cultures.",nan

It will introduce children to Handel (1685-1759) and to ""The Messiah,"" perhaps his greatest work. The story is fantasy based upon many historical elements. In 1740, Handel's successes with Italian opera were no more. The tastes of the English middle class had changed and now favored serious religious works, such as the oratorio. Handel's trip to Dublin to stage the first performance of ""The Messiah"" marked a turning point in his career. The appearance of an elderly Jonathan Swift as Handel's avuncular and forgetful host adds a delightful touch.",nan,"None.

191,The Inner Circle,"Based on a true story, ""The Inner Circle"" recounts events in the life of Stalin's personal projectionist, Ivan Sanshin. In the telling, the Russian writer/director, Andrei Konchalovsky, reveals much about the character of the many Russians who accept totalitarianism. Sanshin worships Stalin. All others, including his wife and his friends, are secondary. Anyone accused of being an ""enemy of the state,"" is shunned, invalidating family ties, friendship, and any sense of justice. Over the years, Sanshin pays a heavy price for his devotion to the state and its leader.",pics/inner-circle-VHScover.jpg,HT,15,"The writer/director of this film, Andrei Konchalovsky, was a leading Russian filmmaker who emigrated to the U.S. during the Cold War. In 1992, referring to ""The Inner Circle,"" he said: I made this film to explain Russia to the Americans. The Americans think the Russians are wonderful people who had a terrible economic system, and all they need is freedom and they will be happy. But it is not that simple. Russians have never been free. There is no precedent for it in our history. Only as recently as 1861 did we free our serfs. Until then, most Russians were slaves - enslaved, not along racial lines, but by other Russians. There is something in our character that values the security of someone telling us what to do. The reason the Russians hated Gorbachev so much was because he told them the truth, he told them they were not happy, and in Russia, to be unhappy was against the law. In the American media, you foresee a happy capitalist Russia developing. I will be happy if we get to the point that Mexico was at in 1920 - a self-sufficient economy where everybody gets enough to eat. (This quote is from Roger Ebert's Review of the film.)",nan,"SERIOUS.

193,Into the Wild,"Into the Wild tells the true story of Chris McCandless, a young man from a troubled family who was enraged by the moral lapses of his mother and father and their multiple failures as parents. McCandless also had a love of nature and adventuring in the wild. Upon graduating near the top of his class from college, McCandless cut himself off from family and friends to go solo adventuring in the Western United States. His last trip was to the Alaskan wilderness where he was found dead of starvation in an abandoned bus. The movie tells the story of the events at home, McCandless' love of nature, his wanderings in the West, the people that he met, and in the final weeks, his epiphany of forgiveness and realization of the importance of human relationships. McCandless' journey was investigated by John Krakauer, a writer for Outdoor Magazine, who tracked the young man's travels seeking to understand both his motives for going on the road and the cause of his untimely death. Benefits of the Movie: Embedded in beautiful scenery and rich in the kind of music that has special appeal to young people, Into The Wild provides important life-lessons that: (1) risky behavior can have fatal consequences; (2) parents need to be careful in raising their children; (3) there are times when children need to forgive their parents; (4) happiness and beauty must be shared to be fully enjoyed; and (5) relationships with people are an essential part of life.

There are short scenes of nudity including brief glimpses of people in a nudist colony and a short scene in which a young Scandinavian woman appears without her top and without embarrassment. There is nothing sensual about the scenes of nudity. There are brief scenes referring to lovemaking that has just occurred or in which we can only hear murmuring and laughter or see people after lovemaking. There is some profanity and crude language. McCandless is badly beaten by a railroad bull. Squirrels and a moose are killed for food, and the audience is shown a squirrel being roasted and the moose being cut-up and dismembered. McCandless is shown slowly wasting away and then dying. TWM advises using this movie despite its R rating because the benefits of the film far outweigh any negatives. Two reasons are given for the R rating: gross language and nudity. Most of the gross language is uttered by the hippie Rainey in brief comments while McCandless is doing sit-ups. Adults concerned about this language can turn the volume down for three or four seconds during this scene. The remaining profanity consists of infrequent examples of garden variety four letter words that teenagers have heard many times. The nudity is simply three women shown going about their lives. There is one scene in which a Scandinavian girl is talking with her boyfriend and McCandless without wearing anything above the waist. There is also a fleeting glimpse of two women walking at a nudist colony. There is nothing sensual about either of these scenes. Because of the R rating, TWM strongly recommends getting administrative and parental permission before showing the film. See TWM's Movie Permission Slip.

Kit also has dreams of becoming a reporter, and plasters pictures of successful women onto her tree house walls; by working at her writing, and never giving up on her dream, Kit ultimately gets an article published in the local newspaper.

The subject matter (impoverished families, broken homes, financial worries, etc.) might upset or worry younger or more sensitive children. Parenting Points:     This is a worthwhile watch for a family. Be prepared for children to ask about your own financial stability, or if you'll ever have to ""sell eggs"" to get by. Have children talk to relatives about their experience with the Great Depression. Did they ever have to take in boarders? How was life different between now and then?

This movie is not history. Members of Lawrence's family have stated that the portrayal of Lawrence as a person is not accurate. There are also historical errors, for example, there is no evidence that T. E. Lawrence was present at the massacre of the Turks, one of the central scenes in the movie. Rather, ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is a fantasy about Lawrence set in an historical framework, i.e., the British campaign against the Turks in the Middle East during WWI; the role of Lawrence in fostering Arab independence, and the British and French betrayal of their promises to the Arabs that independence would be granted to them after WWI. In addition, this is a war movie with violence and death. It is occasionally graphic. In the movie, the Lawrence character is forced by circumstances on two separate occasions to take out a gun and shoot a good friend to death. His actions are morally and militarily defensible in each instance, but they could be upsetting to sensitive children. They were deeply upsetting to Lawrence. This movie portrays the Arabs of the early twentieth century as a people with barbaric ways who, in the words of the Prince Faisal character, are ""unused to explosives and machines."" This is the standard Western view of Arabs of that time. Parenting Points:     This movie is most helpful as an introduction to a little known part of WWI. Read the Helpful Background section, take out a map and show your child where these battles were fought. Talk about the central tragedy of T.E.

358,Introduction to Romeo and Juliet Using a Clip from Shakespeare in Love,"""Shakespeare in Love"" presents students with a brilliantly re-imagined world of the Elizabethan stage and Shakespeare's London. The movie presents an entertaining and accessible speculation about how the playwright could have labored over his words and conceits and, out of his own lost love, found the inspiration for Romeo and Juliet.

The word ""nigger"" is used several times by whites who are portrayed as ignorant and racist. The word ""boy,"" applied to a black man in a derogatory manner, is also used by the villain. This is a story about a place and time in American history when these words were often used to describe African Americans. The story disapproves of the use of these terms.","Rationale for Using the Movie: The script for the film remains true to the novel's intentions, thus the film and the book reinforce each other.

The story is multi-layered and uses many elements of fiction including symbol, motif, and expository phase."
389,Water,"Description: Set in India in 1938, Water opens as Chuyia, an 8-year-old child bride is told by her father that the husband she has seldom met has died. In traditional Indian society, widows are not allowed to remarry and with no son to take care of her, Chuyia must be sent to a widows' ashram to live out a monastic life of deprivation, purity, and prayer.

Soon after Chuyia arrives, Kalyani meets Narayan a young, handsome follower of Mahatma Gandhi, a national leader who advocates many reforms in Indian society. Tragedy, as well as hope, follows in the unfolding of the story.",pics/water-DVD-cover.jpg,LT,13,nan,"Objectives/Student Outcomes Using this Learning Guide:

History Classes: Students will learn about conflicts that come as tradition faces modernity by focusing on the plight of widows in India and the advances advocated by Mahatma Gandhi. 

ELA Classes: The aesthetic qualities of the movie offer an opportunity to explore visual symbols and other devices used in literature as well as film, such as irony and symbol. Students will exercise research and writing skills.",Possible Problems: Minimal. The film earned a PG 13 rating because of sexual situations consisting of verbal references to Kalyani serving as a prostitute and Chuyia being sexually abused. No sex act is shown or described. The brief drug use mentioned in the rating consists of the villains of the story taking a few puffs on a cigar laced with opium or containing some other drug. It is not shown as anything anyone would want to do.,Rationale for Using the Movie: Water exposes students to the rich world of foreign film and to the progressive changes that are reshaping India as well as other rising third world countries. Water is a unique learning experience. Students have been exceptionally open to its story and the many lessons it teaches.
395,White Nights,"An internationally known dancer, Nikolai Rodchenko (Mikhail Baryshnikov), has defected to the West from the Soviet Union during the Cold War. He is flying to Japan when his plane is forced by mechanical problems to crash land at a Soviet air base. Although he tries to destroy his U.S. passport, Rodchenko's identity is discovered by the Soviet KGB. A black American tap dancer, Raymond Greenwood (Gregory Hines), has defected to the Soviet Union because of his disillusionment with the Vietnam War and with racism in the United States. He and his Russian Wife (Isabella Rossellini) are ordered by the KGB to take Rodchenko in, watch him, and convince him to dance again in the Soviet Union.",pics/white-nights-VHScover.jpg,HT,13,"This movie explores the role of an artist in a totalitarian society and during the Cold War. It shows the little known phenomenon of African Americans defecting to the Soviet Union to try to find a society free from racism. It contains beautiful modern dance and tap sequences. The movie contains a fascinating episode about racism, Russian style. Greenwood and his wife have a biracial marriage and are deeply attached to one another. The KGB Colonel in charge of the operation is a racist. To put pressure on Greenwood to watch Rodchenko more carefully, the KGB takes Greenwood's wife away from him. In a ruse to get the KGB to return the woman, Rodchenko thanks the KGB Colonel for removing her, pretending to be disgusted at seeing a white woman married to a black man. He leads the KGB Colonel into a discussion of racist prejudices about sexual attraction between whites and blacks. The ruse works, the wife is returned (in an effort to increase the pressure on Rodchenko) and the couple is overjoyed. This incident is the first step in the development of trust between Rodchenko and Greenwood, which leads to the resolution at the end of the movie. The episode allows us to look at racism as an outsider and, in the process, learn about racism in ourselves and our society.",nan,"MODERATE. Roland Petit's ballet ""The Young Man and Death"" is featured at the beginning of this film. While the dance is beautiful, it involves a portrayal of suicide by hanging. This scene should be used as an opportunity to explain the dangers of playing with ropes or scarves around one's neck and the permanent nature of suicide. There is no graphic violence, but Greenwood is slapped once by his wife and there is a brief punching match between Rodchenko and Greenwood which resolves into a type of embrace. There is a moderate amount of profanity in the movie and most four letter words are used at least once. Rodchenko smokes and drinks, but not to excess. Excessive consumption of vodka is shown in a negative light through other characters, including Greenwood. Parenting Points:     This film will be great for children interested in the arts or in politics, history or political intrigue. See the Helpful Background section. Be sure to discuss with your child the dangers of playing with ropes or scarves around their neck. Immediately after the movie, or at odd times over the next week (for example at the dinner table or in the car on the way to school) bring up the Quick Discussion Question and at least the following: Discussion Questions 2 & 4; Social-Emotional Learning Discussion Question #1; and Moral/Ethical Emphasis Questions 1 & 2. Help your child to answer them.",nan
397,Winged Migration,This movie describes the wonder of avian migration. The filmmakers got very close to the birds as they flew. The photography is spectacular.,pics/winged-migration-dvd-cover.jpg,BL,12,"This movie is an excellent way of introducing and building an interest in a unit on migration. See TWM's Lesson Plan on Migration, Nomadism, and Dormancy.",nan,"NONE. ""Winged Migration"" is a little long for most students to watch the full movie. However, the film follows the migration of one species after another in discrete episodes. It can be easily stopped at the end of any of particular migration. Parenting Points:     This movie is too long for most children in a home environment. Just show about an hour of it and let them stop when they have had enough. Then take them through the pictures and diagrams in TWM's Lesson Plan on Migration, Nomadism, and Dormancy and talk to them a little about what they show. Some display beautiful animals. There is one example of a lopsided V flying formation and there are diagrams of migration routes in North America. It will probably be a good idea for parents to skim the factual portion of the lesson plan before showing the pictures. Ten minutes of preparation will yield great results in the amount of information that can be imparted to a child.",nan
398,The Witness,"""The Witness"" is an award-winning documentary about personal transformation and caring for animals. Eddie Lama, a street wise Brooklyn contractor, takes viewers inside his personal odyssey from animal avoider to animal protector — and then to vegetarian and crusader against the cruelties of the fur industry. It all began when a woman he wanted to date asked him to petsit her cat for the weekend. Eddie Lama is an articulate narrator who speaks from the heart. He tells his story with self-deprecating humor. Mr. Lama's love for animals radiates from the screen and envelopes the audience. The final scenes show Mr. Lama driving a van, outfitted with a large screen TV, playing video clips of the abuse of animals in the fur industry. He parks the van in front of high fashion New York City stores that sell fur. The scenes of animal abuse and the compassionate reactions of the by-standers are riveting. ""The Witness"" is recommended by the American Library Association and has been favorably reviewed in the Library Journal. It has been recommended by officials of the United Federation of Teachers and the California Teachers Association. See ""The Witness"" for Teachers and Librarians. Mr. Lama has received the Courage of Conscience Award for his efforts on behalf of animals. Mr. Lama's condemnation of the fur industry is consistent with charges made against the industry by mainstream animal welfare organizations, such as the Humane Society of the United States. See Caged Fur, the Inside Story.",pics/witness-dvd-cover.jpg,EN,13,"""The Witness"" is an engrossing story of the capacity for emotional and moral growth that all people possess. This movie is appropriate for English Language Arts classes for two additional reasons: (1) it will drive writing and other skills-based assignments; and (2) it will facilitate critical thinking and self-awareness. This film is an excellent vehicle for awakening students to the fact that our actions have implications for animals that we need to take into account. This is a generally held value in society and therefore suitable to be taught in public schools, although most people would not give concerns for animals as high a priority as Mr. Lama. See Possible Problems section below. ""The Witness"" is also an excellent introduction to the animal rights movement, which gains adherents daily and which is an increasingly vocal part of society's current debate about ethics. The fur industry provides a convenient and relatively non-controversial topic through which to acquaint students with the basic arguments for animal rights. See Possible Problems section below. Possible Problems:     MODERATE. The movie contains a scene briefly showing a skinned carcass of an animal killed for its fur and a few short scenes of animals being brutally killed. Similar incidents occur daily in fur ""farms"" and animal markets throughout the world. People need to be well informed if they are to make morally correct choices. In a society in which advertisers spend millions trying to convince consumers to buy a coat made of fur or a jacket trimmed with fur, students need to know the consequences of these purchases. Mr. Lama's concern for animals has not only caused him to mount a crusade against the fur industry, he also refrains from eating meat and consuming dairy products. When discussing the animal rights aspects of this film, teachers in public schools should not advocate for Mr. Lama's ideas, no matter how much they might agree with them. (Note that the authors of this Guide do agree with Mr. Lama's positions and have themselves adopted a vegan lifestyle based on ethical reasons.) Lessons in ethics and morality in public schools should be confined to those on which society has reached a consensus. Ethical veganism is still a minority position, although it gains adherents each year. Most people eat meat and consume dairy products without a thought to the pain and death inherent in the factory farming system. Most people who purchase furs don't think about the caged lives and horrific deaths of the animals who will be draped across their backs. Moreover, it is generally accepted that ethical considerations in eating and dress are the province of a child's family. This is not to say that the arguments of the animal rights movement should not be discussed in schools, public or private. It is a legitimate function for a teacher to expose students to the world in which they live and the discussions about ethics that are taking place in society.",nan,"MODERATE.

(Note also that there are several factors inherent in the choice of food which argue for eating less meat or no meat at all and which are appropriate for advocacy in public schools because they are based on generally accepted facts and consensus values. These include: (1) personal and public health; (2) the fact that the meat industry is one of the worst polluters on the planet; and (3) consumption of meat contributes to food shortages and starvation.
